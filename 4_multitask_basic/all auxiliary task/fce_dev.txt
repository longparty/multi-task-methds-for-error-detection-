Dear c
Ms c
Helen c
Ryan c

Competition c
Organiser c

I c
have c
just c
recieved i
the c
letter c
, c
which c
lets c
me c
know c
that c
I c
have c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
. c

I c
am c
proud c
of c
winning c
it c
and c
would c
like c
to c
say c
how c
thankful i
I c
am c
. c

I c
am c
therefore c
writing c
to c
give c
you c
my c
further c
information c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
am c
a c
student c
and c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
. c

Because i
I c
intend c
to c
take c
examination i
in c
Septenber i
. c

So c
I c
can c
afford c
to c
go c
on c
holiday c
only c
in c
July c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
to c
stay c
at i
log c
cabins c
rather c
than c
tents c
. c

It c
will c
be c
my c
first c
time c
to i
experience c
to i
stay c
there c
and c
I c
am c
interested c
in c
trying c
new c
things c
which c
I c
have c
not c
tried c
. c

The c
next c
consideration c
is c
the c
activities c
. c

Actually c
, c
I c
used c
to c
play c
basketball c
for c
6 c
years c
and c
am c
quite c
confident c
of i
it c
. c

And c
nowadays i
, c
I c
have c
been c
practicing i
tennis c
as c
school i
activity c
. c

Therefore c
I c
would c
like c
to c
choose c
basketball c
and c
tennis c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
am c
considering i
about c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
I c
should c
wear c
and c
how c
much c
I c
need c
. c

I c
would c
be c
most c
grateful c
if c
you c
could c
give c
me c
further c
advicable i
information c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

Hello c
! c
I c
hope c
everything c
around c
you c
is c
alright c
. c

You c
might c
not c
believe c
but i
actually c
I c
helped c
at c
a c
pop c
concert c
last c
month c
and c
I c
really c
enjoyed c
it c
so c
much c
. c

So c
I c
'm c
now c
writing c
to c
let c
you c
know c
how c
grateful i
it c
was c
. c

All c
work i
I c
needed c
to c
do c
was c
n't c
very c
interesting c
. c
which i
I c
must c
have c
set c
thousands c
chairs i
correctly c
and c
after c
finishing c
I c
put c
them c
back c
nicely c
. c

The c
reason c
I c
enjoyed c
it c
very c
much c
is c
that c
I c
could c
meet c
the c
vocalist c
on i
setting c
chairs c
just c
before c
they c
started c
practicing i
. c

I c
was c
asked c
if c
I c
wanted c
to c
sit c
down c
in c
front c
of c
stage i
. c

Naturally c
I c
agreed c
and c
I c
could c
enjoy c
their c
gig c
as c
audience i
. c

It c
was c
absolutely c
fantastic c
. c

I c
had c
ever c
never c
sit i
down c
there c
. c

Additionally c
, c
you c
could i
n't c
believe c
, i
but c
the c
vocalist c
said c
" c
All c
the c
chairs c
you c
are c
sitting c
down i
were i
set c
from i
him c
, c
" c
pointing c
at c
me c
! c
! c

Actually c
I c
was c
a c
bit c
ashamed c
but c
it c
will c
be c
my c
brilliant c
memory c
. c

Anyway c
it c
was c
so c
interesting c
time i
that c
I c
did c
n't c
even c
feel c
tired c
after c
that c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
suggest c
you c
should c
try c
as c
I c
did c
if c
you c
have c
any c
opportunity c
. c
You c
must i
like c
it c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
seeing c
you c
soon c
. c

Can c
you c
send c
me c
the i
letter c
back c
writing c
what c
happend i
to c
you c
recently c
. i

Bye c
! c

Love c
, c

At i
the c
begining c
I c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
. c

Now c
I c
am c
going c
to c
give c
you c
some c
further c
informations i
I i
would c
like c
to c
travel c
only c
in c
July c
because c
I c
am c
a c
student c
in c
High i
school c
and c
this c
is c
most i
important c
year c
of c
my c
life c
I i
am c
studying c
to i
university i
entrance c
exams c
and c
I c
have c
to c
study c
until c
the c
end c
of c
June c
and c
then c
by i
the c
end c
of c
June c

will c
be i

university i
entrance c
exam c
after i
that c
in i
July c
I i
am c
going c
to c
be c
alright c
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
tents i
because c
I c
have c
never c
stay i
in c
tents i
before c
and c
I c
am c
wondering c
how i
it c
is c
going c
to c
be c
like c
And i
among i
these c
activities c
I c
am i
choosing c
basketball c
and c
swimming c
. c

Basketball c
because c
I c
am c
very c
good c
at c
it c
, c
swimming c
because c
I c
like c
to c
swim c
very c
much c
but c
I c
'm c
not c
a c
very c
good c
swimmer c
. c

And c
finally c
I c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
you c
some c
questions c
. c

My c
first c
question c
is c
about c
clothes c
; c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
do c
we c
need c
to c
take c
with c
us c
? c
and i
How i
much c
money c
do c
we c
need c
to c
take c
? c

Finally c
what i
kind c
of c
wheather i
is c
waiting c
for c
us c
? c

Thank c

for c
Every i
thing c

Your i
sincerely c

Dear c
M. c
Smith c
, c

My c
name c
is c
Marie c
Bouchard c
, c
I c
come c
from c
Switzerland c
. c

Two c
weeks c
ago c
, c
I c
spent c
a c
week c
in c
your c
fabulous c
city c
of c
London c
with c
my c
friend c
. c

On c
Thursday c
, c
the c
3rd c
of c
May c
2000 c
, c
we c
went c
to c
your c
theatre c
to c
see c
" c
Over c
the c
rainbow c
" c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
we c
were c
really c
disappointed c
about c
everything c
in c
the c
theatre c
. c

Firstly c
, c
we c
got c
our c
tickets c
in i
your c
ticket c
office c
just c
one c
hour c
before c
the c
show c
. c

We c
thought c
, c
as c
usual i
we c
do c
in c
London c
theatre i
, c
we c
could c
have i
discounts c
as i
it c
's c
written c
on c
your c
advertisement c
. i

Surprisily i
, c
there c
were c
no c
discounds i
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
show c
started c
at c
20:15 c
instead c
of c
19:30 c
, i
it c
's c
a c
theatre c
but i
not c
a c
concert c
hall c
! c
! c
! c
! c

Thirdly c
, c
we c
were c
astonished c
about i
the c
actors c
whose i
we c
know c
from c
others i
musical i
. c

Why c
did c
you c
not c
change c
the c
name i
of i
your c
advertisement c
? c

In c
the c
end c
, c
the c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
because c
you c
did c
n't c
have c
enough c
staffs i
, i
this i
evening c
! c
! c

Nothing i
was c
serious c
. c

We c
really c
like c
London c
, c
the c
people c
, c
the c
night c
- c
life c
but c
this c
evening c
was c
really c
awful c
. c

I c
sent i
to i
you c
a c
copie i
of c
our c
tickets c
. c

Would c
you c
pleased i
return c
our c
money c
back i
. c

In c
advance c
, c
thank c
you c
. c

I c
hope c
we c
are c
not c
the c
only c
people c
to c
be c
so c
upset c
, c
but c
it c
was c
the c
first c
and c
the c
last c
time c
that c
I c
came i
in i
your c
theatre c
. c

Sincerely c
yours c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

When c
her c
best c
friend c
, c
Scala c
, c
asked c
her c
an i
idea c
to c
surprise c
her c
husband c
because i
she c
's i
pregnant c
, c
Pat c
put c
her c
feets i
in c
the c
plate c
just c
before c
Scala c
's c
husband c
got i
the c
surprise c
. c

The c
problem c
is c
that c
Pat c
works c
in c
the i
Neubathin c
a i
little c
village c
. c

She c
's c
a c
secretary c
in c
an c
office c
. c

Everybody c
knows c
everybody c
. c

Pat c
and c
Scala c
have c
been c
good c
friends c
for c
10 c
years c
, c
their c
husband i
too i
. c

It c
was c
a c
Friday i
suny c
afternoon c
, c
Scala c
was c
really c
excited c
to i
tell c
her c
the c
new i
. c

Despite c
she i
knew c
that c
Pat c
could c
n't c
keep c
secret i
but i
for c
this c
time c
she c
was c
confident c
maybe i
too i
. c

Just c
after c
Scala c
told c
her c
the c
new i
, c
Pat c
phoned c
her c
mother c
who c
worked c
in c
a c
bakery c
, c
to c
tell c
that i
Scala c
is i
pregnant c
. c

As c
usual c
, c
Jon c
, c
Scala c
's c
husband c
came c
& c
bought c
the c
bread c
for c
the c
evening c
. c

Pat c
's c
mum c
was c
so c
excited c
about c
the c
baby c
, c
she c
just c
said c
" c
Congratulations c
for i
the c
new c
baby c
. c
" c

He c
was c
so c
amazed c
and c
asked c
to i
repeat c
. i

She c
just c
thought i
it c
would i
be i
a c
secret c
, c
she i
came i
really c
embarassed i
. c

When c
he c
went c
back c
to c
his c
house c
, c
his c
wife c
gave c
him c
the c
box c
with c
the c
shoes c
but c
it c
was c
n't c
a c
surprise c
! c

Scala c
was c
hungry i
with c
Pat c
because c
she c
thought c
she c
can i
keep c
this c
kind c
of c
secret c
. c

Sir c
manager c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
order c
to c
complain c
about c
what c
you c
have c
written c
in c
the c
advertisement c
on i
the c
newspaper c
. c

I c
am c
disappointed c
because c
of c
the c
horrible c
evening c
I c
have c
had c
, i
I c
was c
on c
holiday c
in c
London c
and c
I c
did c
not c
have c
time i
enough c
to c
spend c
there c
, c
but c
when c
you c
said c
that c
show i
was c
the c
best c
I c
decided c
to c
go c
. c

When c
I c
bought c
my c
ticket c
I c
asked c
for c
a c
discount c
and c
they c
said c
it i
was c
not c
available c
. c

At c
first c
it c
was c
not c
a c
problem c
because c
if c
the c
show c
was c
going c
to c
be c
the c
best c
it i
would c
cost i
what c
they c
said i
. c

I c
arrived c
at c
the c
theatre c
in c
time c
and c
the c
musical c
show i
started c
later c
than c
I c
expected c
so c
I c
was c
getting c
nervous i
because c
I c
dislike i
very c
much c
the i
impuntuality i
, c
but c
that c
was c
not c
all c
. c

When c
the c
show c
started c
the c
person c
who c
was c
acting c
it i
was c
not c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
he i
seemed i
not c
to c
be c
an c
actor c
. c

Really c
he c
was c
bad c
. c

Afterwards c
I c
decided c
to c
go c
for c
a c
meal c
in c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
but c
It c
was c
closed c
. c

So c
you c
can c
imagine c
how c
I c
felt c
because c
of c
the c
irritating c
evening c
out c
I c
had c
. c

I c
am c
letting i
down c
because i
of c
your c
behaviour c
. c

You c
wanted c
to c
cheat c
me c
, c
so c
I c
will c
be c
very c
pleasure i
if c
you c
could c
give c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
your i
answer c
. c

Your i
faithfully c
, c

I c
think c
technology c
has c
changed c
my c
life c
and c
the c
way c
of c
living i
of c
almost c
all i
people c
around c
the c
world c
. c

First c
of c
all c
technology i
is c
very c
useful c
nowadays c
but c
really c
I c
dislike c
it c
because c
in c
some c
ways c
we c
are c
becoming c
machines c
too c
. c

Since c
the c
creation c
of c
PCs c
, c
people c
- c
and c
me c
too c
, c
of c
course c
- c
are i
making i
different c
things c
. c

For c
example c
we c
can c
buy c
food c
, c
clothes c
and c
whatever c
we c
need c
by c
internet i
or c
by c
telephone c
. c

I c
can c
know i
what c
is c
happening c
in c
differents i
parts c
of c
the c
world c
in c
a c
few c
minutes c
. c

A c
very c
good c
point i
of c
this c
change c
is c
that c
women c
have c
more c
freedom c
to c
have i
a c
job c
because c
before c
reaching i
the c
technology c
they c
have i
to c
stay c
at c
home c
doing c
housework c
but c
now c
we c
have c
laundries c
and c
a c
lot c
of c
machines c
like c
microwave c
oven i
. c

In i
my c
case c
I c
dislike c
computers c
. c

I c
do c
n't c
know c
how c
to c
use c
them c
but c
I c
know c
I c
have c
to c
change c
because c
they c
help c
us i
to c
make c
our c
lives c
easier c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
what c
will c
happen c
with i
us c
in c
the c
future c
? c

Our c
life i
will c
be c
managed c
by c
robots c
and c
they c
will c
replace c
us c
in i
our c
jobs c
. c

So c
, c
what c
are c
we c
going c
to c
do c
? c

Something c
that c
I c
note c
about c
technology c
is c
that c
we c
are c
loosing i
green c
places c
and c
there c
are i
a c
lot c
of c
pollution c
, c
so c
we c
have c
to c
be c
careful c
. c

Dear c
Mr. c
Ryan c
, c

I c
received c
your c
letter c
and c
I c
am c
very c
glad c

have c
won c
a c
two c
weeks i
travel i
to c
Camp c
California c
. c

I c
will c
give c
you c
some c
information c
which c
helps i
you c
to c
know c
me c
better c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c

best c
time c

About i
accommodation c
, c
I c
think c
tents c

be c
great c
. c

Basketball c
and c
swimming c
I c
think c
are c
the c
best c
for c
the c
children c
. c

Basketball c
will c
help c
children i
to c
build c
team c
character i
and c
leadership c
. i

And c
swimming c
is c
very c
good c
for c
health i
. c

I c
swim c
really c
good i
and c
I c
am c
a c
proffesional i
basketball c
player c

I c
count i
on c
my c
experience c
. c

And c
there c
are c
few i
questions c

would c

to c
our c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

Last c
month c
I c
enjoyed c
helping c
at c
concert i
of c
" c
Modern c
Talking c
'' c
and c
now c
I c
want c
to c
share c
with c
you c
about i
my c
experience c
. c

It c
all c
started c
when c
one c
of c
the c
organizers c
asked c
me c
to c
help c
him c
at c
a c
concert c
of c
my c
favorite i
band c
. c

And c
what c
do c
you c
think c
I c
answered c
? c

Of c
course c
, c
yes c
! c

I c
have i
got i
very c
responsible i
work c
I i
had c
to c
bring c
food c
for c
Peter c
Bolen c
and c
Tomas c
Anders c
. c

Can c
you c
imagine c
? c

I c
came i
into c
their c
room c
and c
give i
hot c
Cheeseburgers c
, c
Coca c
- c
Cola c
and c
ice c
- c
cream c
to c
Peter c
. c

It c
was c
the c
happiest c
moment c
of c
my c
life c
. c

He c
asked c
me c
was i
the c
cheeseburger c
hot c
and c
I c
answered c
that c
it c
was c
. c

I c
was c
very c
nervous c
talking c
with c
him c
. c

He c
told c
me c
about c
concert i
programme c
and c
gave c
me c
his c
photo c
with c
a i
sign i
. c

I c
will c
never c
forget c
that c
summer c
day c
. c

It c
was c
my c
day c
, c
I c
am c
sure c
about c
it c
. c

Well c
, c
I c
think c
that c
is c
all c
. c

See c
you c
. c

Yours i
faithfully c
, c

Vasiliy c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writting i
to c
you c
about c
the c
show c
. c

I c
was c
very c
disappointed c
after c
this i
show c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
have c
my c
money c
back c
. c

At i
first c
the c
show c
started c
at c
10.15 c
, c
and c
it c
should c
be i
at c
19.30 c
. c

After c
your c
show c
I c
wanted c
to c
visit c
my c
friends c
, c
and c
because c
of c
it c
, c
I c
did i
n't c
do c
it i
. c

Also c
, c
you c
wrote c
about c
discounts c
, c
but c
it c
's i
not c
true c
! c

The c
woman c
, i
who c
sold c
a i
ticket c
was c
very c
roud i
with i
me c
, c
actually c
she c
started c
swearing c
at c
me c
. c

During c
the c
show c
, c
I c
was c
very c
hungry c
but c
I c
hoped c
to c
visit c
restaurant i
, c
it i
's c
a c
pity c
, c
but i
restaurant i
was c
closed c
because c
it c
was c
too c
late c
. c

And c
, c
I c
forget c
to c
say c
about i
actor i
, c
I c
did c
n't c
enjoy c
them c
. c

So c
, c
I c
hope c
I c
will c
get c
my c
money c
back c
, i
it c
was c
very i
disappointing c
evening c
out i
in c
my c
life c
! c
I c
hope c
you c
understand c
me c
! c

your i
sincerely c

Ongelina c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
, c
but c
any i
way c
I c
trusted c
him c
. c

It c
's i
happened c
3 c
months c
ago c
, c
and c
during c
this i
months i
I c
am i
very c
upset c
. c

I c
have c
a c
friend c
, c
his c
name c
Peter i
, c
he c
is c
my c
best c
friend c
. c

One c
day c
Peter c
killed c
one i
boy c
. c

They c
were c
just c
playing c
and c
be i
acsident i
, c
Peter c
shoot i
him c
. c

I c
was c
there c
, c
I c
saw c
it c
. c

I c
hoped i
that c
it c
, i
just i
could c
see i
3 i
people c
, c
but c
it i
was c
mistake i
... c

Pat c
saw c
it c
! c

We c
spoke i
with c
Pat c
many c
times c
to c
keep c
this c
secret c
, c
not c
to c
tell c
anyone c
. c

We c
trusted c
him c
. c

At i
first c
several i
days c
, c
Pat c
all i
the c
time c
was c
with c
us c
. c

He c
promised c
to c
keep c
secret i
, i
in c
the c
next c
morning c
we c
had c
arguiment i
with c
Pat c
, i
3 i
of c
us c
were c
shouting c
at c
each c
other c
, i
in c
shorter i
Pat i
went i
away c
from c
us c
. c

Two c
days c
later c
in i
the c
morning c
, c
the i
policeman c
came c
to c
Peter i
... c

So c
, c
now c
my c
best c
friend c
is c
prisoner i
. c

All c
the c
time c
I i
am c
thinking c
about c
Peter c
. c

I c
do c
n't c
forget c
him c
. c

He c
will c
be c
in c
the i
prison c
5 i
years c
. c

By c
the c
way c
I i
do i
n't c
see i
Pat c
about i
one c
year c
. c

Perhaps c
, c
he c
moved c
into i
another c
town c
. c

It c
's c
good c
that c
he c
far i
away c
... c
I c
miss c
Peter c
very c
much c
, c
it c
's c
unfair c
to c
put c
him c
in c
a c
prison c
. c

But c
it c
's c
life c
, c
destiny c
, c
very c
cruel c
destiny c
... c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
you c
regarding c
the c
letter c
you c
sent c
me c
, i
about c
the c
two c
weeks c
at c
Camp c
California c
that c
I c
won c
. c

Firstly c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
because c
I c
have c
2 c
weeks c
off c
in i
the c
beginning c
of c
the c
month c
. c

For c
the c
accommodation c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
in i
tents i
because c
I c
like c
adventure c
and c
simplicity c
. c

Concerning c
the c
available c
activities c
, c
firstly c
, c
I c
would c
choose c
climbing c
because c
I c
have c
practised i
it c
for c
many c
years c
. c

Secondely i
, c
I c
am c
interested c
in c
discovering i
something c
that c
I c
have c
never c
done c
, c
so c
I c
would c
like c
to c
do c
sailing c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
was c
wondering c
if c
some i
special c
clothes c
are c
required c
and c
how c
much c
pocket c
money c
I c
need c
for c
this c
trip c
? c

I c
thank c
you c
in c
advanced i
and c
looking i
forward c
to c
your c
reply c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
you c
to c
relate i
my c
experience c
in i
helping c
at c
a c
pop c
concert c
last c
month c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
tell c
you c
that c
I c
've c
never c
had c
a i
such c
good c
time c
in c
my c
life c
! c

The c
day i
one c
consisted i
in c
surrounding c
the c
festival i
's c
place i
with c
fences c
. c

The c
second c
day c
objective i
was c
to c
install c
the c
scene i
, i
with i
lights c
, c
loudspeakers c
and c
all c
stuff i
. c

This c
job c
was c
quite c
hard c
, c
but c
we c
took c
enough i
time c
to i
be c
not c
exhausted c
! c

The c
last c
day c
, c
in i
fact c
the i
concert c
day c
was i
absolutely c
fantastic c
. c

The c
public i
was c
so c
excited c
to c
see c
the c
concert c
that c
we c
had c
to c
place c
some c
bouncer i
front i
of c
the c
scene i
, i
to c
avoid i
the i
people c
coming i
on c
the c
concert c
floor c
. c

Finally c
, c
the c
concert c
was c
exactly c
that i
the c
people c
were c
expected i
. c

I c
hop i
that c
the c
next c
time c
you c
will c
come c
with c
me c
! c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
your i
impressions c
about c
this c
! c

See c
you c
soon c
. c

Dear c
Clark c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
you c
because c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
my c
personal c
opinion c
about c
the c
' c
international c
arts c
festival c
. c
' c

First c
of c
all c
I c
have c
to c
say c
that c
the c
whole c
festival c
was c
a c
greatful i
success c
and c
I c
also c
think c
you c
chose c
an c
appropriate c
title c
for c
the c
leaflet c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
some c
points c
which c
can c
be c
improved c
for c
the c
next c
year c
. c

To c
begin c
with c
, c
you c
wrote c
down i
in c
the c
leaflet c
that c
stars c
and c
artists c
from c
around c
the c
world c
could c
be c
seen c
in c
the c
performance c
in i
fact c
their i
were c
only c
six c
countries c
involved c
. c

My c
suggestion c
for c
this c
point c
is c
to c
invite c
more c
people c
from c
different c
countries c
. c

Furthermore c
is i
that c
some c
concert c
halls c
were c
definitely c
to i
small c
or c
in c
other c
words c
to i
many c
people c
attended c
those c
concerts c
. c

This i
kind c
of c
problem c
you c
could c
avoid c
when i
you c
look c
for c
big c
halls c
at c
the c
begining i
. c

Another c
point c
where c
you c
could c
improve c
is c
when i
you c
show c
more c
plays c
and c
films c
next c
year c
. c

Nearly c
at c
the c
end c
of c
this c
letter c
I c
have c
to c
say c
that c
the c
idea c
with i
the c
weekend c
ticket c
was c
really c
good c
because c
it c
gave c
to i
the c
people c
the c
opportunity c
to c
attemp i
a i
whole c
weekend c
for c
a c
cheap c
price c
. c

To c
finish c
this c
letter c
with i
I i
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
a c
good c
idea c
for c
next c
year c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
it c
would c
be c
nice c
if c
you c
create i
an c
exhibition c
place i
where c
the c
guests c
can c
try c
to c
play c
different c
instruments c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

How c
can c
you c
earn c
money c
in c
your c
spare c
time c
? c

I c
think c
everybody c
will c
ask c
himself c
this c
question c
one c
day c
or c
has c
already c
asked c
it c
. c

Anyway c
the c
people c
where i
asked c
this c
question c
probably c
found c
out c
that c
it c
is c
n't c
so c
easy c
to c
earn c
money c
or c
that c
it c
is c
sometimes c
to i
much c
work c
. c

A c
traditional c
way c
to c
earn c
money c
, c
in c
the i
spare c
time c
, c
is c
to c
bring i
newspapers c
or c
magazines c
to c
the c
families c
in c
your c
town c
or c
village c
. c

The c
problems i
that c
you c
have c
here c
is c
the c
weather c
. c

For c
example c
when c
it c
is c
rainy c
, c
because c
then c
everything c
get i
wet c
. c

Another c
suggestion c
is c
that c
you c
go c
to c
your c
cinema c
and c
ask c
if c
they c
need c
your c
help c
for i
changing c
the c
film c
rolls c
, c
for i
cleaning c
the c
toilets c
or c
to i
do c
some c
other c
small c
jobs c
. c

But c
in c
the c
case c
that c
you c
really c
want c
to c
do c
some c
interesting c
work c
in c
your c
spare c
time c
you c
should c
try c
to c
sell c
something c
where i
you c
're c
good c
at c
, c
I c
mean c
if c
you c
're c
interested c
in c
computers c
you c
should c
try c
to c
provide c
your c
service c
for c
other c
people c
. c

Of c
course c
in c
the c
begining i
it c
is c
hard c
but c
you c
can c
learn c
a c
lot c
and c
if c
you c
're c
good c
at c
you i
'll c
also c
earn c
some c
money c
. c

Okay c
do c
n't c
wait c
, c
there i
where c
you c
're c
good c
at c
and c
begin c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
madam c

I c
am c
writing c
with c
regard c
to c
your c
advertisment i
. c

During c
my c
2 c
week i
's c
holiday c
I c
would i
like c
to c
attend c
a c
musical c
show c
. c

It c
was c
my c
favorite i
play i
. c

I c
was c
very c
hopefull i
that c
I c
was c
going c
to c
have c
a c
good c
time c
. c

But c
there c
were c
many i
things c
which c
went c
wrong c
. c

Firstly c
, c
I c
have i
had c
no c
discount c
at i
paying i
. c
secondly i
there c
was c
delay i
which c
got c
me c
into c
trouble c
, i
After c
the c
show c
I c
could c
n't c
catch c
my c
train c
. c

Because c
I c
did c
n't c
have c
any c
plan c
I c
decided c
to c
have c
a i
lunch c
in c
theatre i
restaurant c
. c

But c
it c
was c
closed c
. c

The c
worst c
thing c
is c
that c
I c
could c
n't c
watch i
my c
favorite i
actor c
. c

I c
was c
so c
dissapointted i
with i
that c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
consentrate i
on c
the c
play c
any c
more c
. c

Contrary i
to c
the c
advertisment i
everything c
was c
disapointing i
. c

I c
regret c
to i
demand c
all c
my c
expenses i
. i

I c
hope c
you c
are c
going c
to c
be c
take c
into c
consideration c
my c
terrible c
situation i
. c

I c
am c
waiting c
for c
a c
satisfactory c
answer c

Yours c
faithfully c

Azami c

Technology c
has c
developed c
increasingly i
in c
recent c
years c
. c

As c
a c
result c
of c
this c
our c
society c
has c
changed c
a c
lot c
. c

On c
the c
one c
hand c
technology c
has c
made c
our c
lives c
more c
comfortable c
and c
easier c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
we c
have c
faced c
some c
problems c
, c
such c
as c
social c
and c
environmental c
problems c
. c

Nowadays c
students c
have c
much i
more c
facilitis i
in c
education c
than c
before c
. c

Although c
in c
those c
days c
the c
only c
way c
of c
learning c
was c
reading c
. c

These c
days c
we c
can c
use c
computer i
, c
television c
and c
some c
sophisticated c
equipment c
. i
which c
were c
unusuall i
before i
. c

Than i
to i
technology c
we c
can c
reach c
any c
place c
in c
the c
world c
easily c
. c

We c
can c
get c
some i
information c
more c
quickly c
. c

Technology c
has c
a c
huge c
effect c
on c
our c
spare c
time i
activities c
as c
well c
. c

Children c
play c
wit i
computer i
instead c
of c
usuall i
plays i
. c

Despite c
the c
huge c
facilities i
technology i
has c
affected c
our c
lives c
negatively c
. c

There c
has c
been c
change i
relatinships i
between c
people c
. c

People c
are c
getting c
more c
and c
more c
lonely c
. c

We c
have c
noticed c
the c
environmential i
damage c
in c
recent c
years c
. c

While c
we c
are c
using c
technology c
, c
we c
should c
take c
into c
consideration c
environment i
. c

We c
should c
n't c
allow c
to i
be c
exploited c
the c
world c
. c

If c
we c
want c
to c
leave c
a c
good c
world c
to c
the c
next c
generations c
, c
we c
should c
behave c
more c
respectfully c
againgst i
the i
nature c
. c

Dear c
Mr. c
Clark c
, c

I c
'm c
a i
italian i
student c
who c
has i
come c
to c
the c
last c
International c
Arts c
Festival c
. c

I c
think c
this c
festival c
is c
a c
great c
idea c
because c
it c
's c
a i
possibility i
to c
see c
and c
to c
love i
the i
art c
, c
but c
, i
I c
think i
also c
there c
are c
some c
things c
thas i
could c
be c
changed c
. c

I c
noticed c
that c
the c
artists c
were c
from c
only c
six c
countries c
insted i
that c
from c
around c
the c
world c
. c

This c
choice i
does c
n't c
give c
many c
artists c
the c
possibility i
to c
expresse i
themself i
. c

Some c
concert c
halls c
were c
too c
small c
and c
often c
people c
could c
n't c
see c
the c
performances c
. c

There c
were c
many c
events c
that i
I c
think c
there c
were c
a c
few c
plays c
and c
films c
. c

Maybe c
it c
would c
be c
better c
put i
more c
of c
them c
in c
the c
programme c
because c
they i
like c
so c
much c
to c
young c
people c
. c

The i
very c
about c
young c
people c
, c
the c
choice i
to c
offer c
a c
reasonably c
- i
priced c
weekend c
ticket c
is c
a i
excellent c
idea c
because c
it c
brings i
them c
to c
have c
a c
contact c
with c
all c
what c
it c
art c
. c

I c
hope c
that c
my c
opinion c
can c
help c
you c
to c
set i
fro i
the i
next c
year c
a c
great c
internation i
arts c
festival c
alone i
to c
young c
people c
. c

Thank c
you c
and c
greetings i
. c

I c
think c
a c
good c
way c
to c
get c
money c
it i
's c
work i
in c
a c
fast c
- c
food c
. i

Maybe c
the c
first c
impression c
is c
n't c
positive c
but c
from i
my c
personal c
experience c
, c
I c
can c
say c
that c
this c
kind c
of c
job c
is c
right i
for c
get i
some c
money c
. c

For c
six c
months c
I c
've c
worked c
in c
a c
McDonald c
's c
restaurant c
in c
Italy c
and c
I c
've c
got c
lots c
of c
money c
. c

I c
worked c
eight c
hours c
every c
day c
but i
in c
every c
fast c
- c
food c
you i
can c
work c
part c
- c
time c
, c
four c
, c
three c
, c
six c
hours c
every c
day c
. c

It c
depends c
on c
what c
you c
need c
. c

This c
kind c
of c
job c
is c
perfect c
for c
the i
young c
people c
who c
want c
get i
money c
and c
in i
the c
meantime c
they i
have c
to c
study c
. c

If c
you c
work c
in c
a c
fast c
- c
food c
you i
can c
work c
in c
the c
afternoon c
, c
or c
during c
the c
night c
and i
so c
you c
have c
time c
for c
yourself c
. c

In i
the c
staff c
you c
can c
also c
find c
young c
people c
and c
getting i
fun c
with c
them c
during c
the i
work c
. c

What c
do i
you c
want c
more c
? c

If c
you c
need c
money c
and c
you c
need c
time c
for c
yourself c
try c
a c
job c
like c
that c
. c

Dear c
Sir c

of c
June c

and c
I c
was c
very c
disappinted i
. c

I c
was c
promised c
that c

but c
when c

worse c
, c
I c

I c
was c

deffinately i

and c
tired c
. c

You c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Phukana c
Najee c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

I c
have c
a c
really c
good c
, i
freind i
, c
Pat c
who c
I c
was i
trusted c
and c
counted c
on c
her i
. c

I c
have c
know i
her c
for c
five c
years c
. c

and i
we c
were i
love i
each c
other c
very c
much c
. c

One c
day c
, c
I c
was i
falling c
in c
love c
with c
closest i
freind i
. c

I c
went c
out c
with c
him c
sometimes c
and c
we c
were c
happy c
. c

My c
boy i
freind c
was c
very c
handsome c
, c
clever c
and c
very c
polite c
. c

We c
were c
stedy i
at i
the c
same c
class c
at c
school c
and c
he c
also c
knowed i
Pat c
as c
well c
. c

Personally c
, c
I c
wanted c
to c
keep c
serets i
because c
I c
afraid i
that c
we c
might c
have i
splited c
up c
. c

And c
I c
would c
like c
to c
make c
sure c
that c
he c
was i
relly i
love i
me c
. c

My c
boy i
freind c
told c
me c
that c
he c
wanted c
to c
surprise c
his c
freind i
in c
his c
class c
when c
the c
times i
comes c
. c

To c
be c
honest c
, c
I c
wanted c
to c
share c
this c
felling i
to i
someone c
else c
but c
I c
needed c
to c
keep c
very i
secret c
. c

I c
felt c
unhappy c
sometimes c
. c

One c
day c
I c
decided c
to c
tell c
my c
best c
freind i
- c
Pat c
who i
I c
realio i
- c
on c
her i
. c

I c
told c
her c
everything c
abat i
my c
boyfreind i
and c
when c
we c
were i
met c
each c
other c
and c
evertauly i
we i
were i
falling c
in c
love c
. c

After c
I c
told c
her c
I c
felt c
my c
feeling c
had c
been c
released c
and c
I c
was c
happy c
. c

I c
also c
told c
her c
to c
keep c
very i
secret c
did i
n't c
tell c
anyone c
in c
the c
class c
. c

On c
Monday c
morning c
, c
I c
walked c
into c
the c
class c
and c
all c
of c
my c
freind i
was i
shouting c
at c
me c
and c
called i
my c
name c
and c
my i
boyfreind i
. c

I c
was c
absolutely i
ambaressed i
and c
I c
wanted c
to c
ran i
out c
of c
the c
class c
. c

I c
felt c
very c
angry c
to i
Pat c
and c
I c
should c
n't c
have c
told c
her c
about c
my c
boy i
friend c
. c

I c
felt c
regret c
but c
too i
late c
it i
was c
n't c
secret i
any i
more c
now c
. c

13th c
June c
, c
2000 c

Dear c
Mrs c
Ryan c
, c

I c
recived i
your c
letter c
and c
I c
am c
very c
excited c
about c
the c
camp c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
go c
in c
July c
I i
do c
n't c
mind c
wich i
two c
weeks c
but i
it c
has c
to c
be c
that c
month c
because c
in c
June c
I c
still i
in c
school c
and c
in c
August c
I'am i
going c
on c
holiday c
with c
my c
family c
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
to c
sleep c
in c
a c
tent c
because c
I c
think c
it c
's c
different c
from c
where c
I c
sleep c
every c
night c
so c
I c
would c
apreciate i
it c
if c
there c
are c
still c
tents c

I c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

Hello c
girl c
how i
are c
you c
doing c
this i
days c
. i

I c
am i
great c
especially i
last c
weekend c
in i
the c
concert i
of c
Backstreet c
Boys c
. c

It c
was c
so c
exciting c
. c

They c
were c
giving c
two c
concerts c
one i
in i
Friday c
and c
the c
other c
one c
in i
Saturday c
they i
invited c
me c
to c
go c
on c
friday i
. c

This c
is c
what c
happened c
: c
when c
I c
arrive i
they c
told c
me c
that c
I c
was c
helping c
in i
backstage c
with c
the c
scenery c
, i
then c
the c
group c
arrived c
, c
we c
chat c
for c
like c
15 c
minutes c
then i
they c
had c
to c
go c
on c
stage c
. c

Here c
is c
where c
the c
good c
part c
starts c
, c
I c
was c
doing c
the c
courtines i
( c
opening c
and c
closing c
) c
when c
Nick c
came c
to i
me c
and c
ask i
me c
to c
go c
on c
stage c
with c
him c
, i
my c
heart c
started c
beating c
very c
hard c
. c

The c
next c
second c
I c
was c
in c
front c
of c
more c
than c
2 c
thousand c
people c
dancing c
with c
The c
Backstreet c
Boys c
. c

I c
had c
a c
great c
time c
that c
day c
. c

Well c
I c
have c
to c
go c
now c
. c

Hope c
to c
hear c
from c
you c
later c
on i
. c

Love c
, c

Anni c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
The c
Circle c
Theatre c
manager c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
your c
product i
. c

I c
would c
like c
you c
to c
back i
my c
money c
because c
that i
was c
not c
same c
as c
your c
advertisement c
. c

I c
was c
planning c
to c
spend c
my c
holiday c
in c
London c
when c
I c
found c
your c
advertisement c
. c

In c
the c
advertisement c
, c
you c
mentioned c
actors c
, c
time c
, c
price i
discount c
and c
equipment i
. c

DANNY c
BROOK c
is c
one c
of c
my c
favorite i
actor i
so c
I c
decided c
to c
buy c
a c
ticket c
even c
if i
I c
cancel i
my c
apointment i
on c
that c
day c
at c
18=30 i
and c
aslo i
notice i
of c
price c
discount c
impressed c
me c
. c

However c
, c
when c
I c
went i
to c
the c
theatre c
, c
you c
did i
n't c
anything c
not c
only c
discount i
but c
also c
apporogize i
us i
for c
dalay i
of i
starting c
musical i
. c

In c
addition c
different i
actor c
appeared c
on c
the c
stage c
and c
I c
could c
n't c
have c
dinner c
about i
the c
musical c
because c
the c
restrant i
had i
been c
closed c
. c

It c
made c
me c
so c
dissapoint i
and c
angry c
. c

You c
should c
back i
my c
money c
immedeastry i
because c
that c
night c
was c
far c
from c
parfect i
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Faithfully c
, c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

He c
always c
tried c
to c
say c
nothing c
and c
did c
. c

But c
everyone c
always c
noticed i
he i
had c
secrets c
from c
his c
face c
. c

Whenever c
he c
has c
secrets i
, c
his c
nose c
moves c
quickly c
. c

He c
had i
not c
liked c
this c
habit c
and c
had c
thought c
it c
was c
wrost i
of c
him c
until c
he c
solved c
a c
big c
crime c
. c

When c
all c
money i
had c
gone c
from c
a c
bank c
, c
nobady i
there i
except c
Pat c
. c

Bank i
robbers c
said i
him c
if c
Pat c
told c
the i
fact c
somebody c
they c
killed i
him c
. c

So c
. i

Pat c
did c
n't c
say c
anything c
. c

But c
his c
nose c
moved c
quickly c
when c
police i
showed c
a i
picture c
of c
bank i
robbers c
. c

Then c
police i
realized c
who c
were i
bank c
robbers c
and c
arested i
them c
. c

Although c
bank i
robbers c
complained c
to c
Pat c
, c
he c
said i
nothing c
to c
anybody c
. c

He c
just c
moved c
his c
nose c
! c
! c

Thanks c
to c
his c
habit c
, c
he c
is c
still c
alive c
and c
all c
money i
were i
backed i
to c
the c
bank c
. c

The c
town c
became c
peace i
again c
. c

I c
guess c
it c
was c
the c
best c
concert c
I c
've c
ever c
been c
to c
, c
but c
the c
coolest c
thing c
is c
that c
, c
well c
do c
you c
remember c
my c
friend c
Luke c
, c
the c
one c
that c

as c

guard c
, i
well c

me c
that c
they c
needed c

told i
me c

the c
U.S.A. c

In c
answer c
at i
your c
letter c
. i

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
for c
two c
reason i
one i
's c
is i
because c
I c
totaly i

date i
and c
the c
other c

second c
question c
. c

About c
accommodation c
during c
these c
two c
weeks c
at c
the c
Camp c
I i
would c
prefer c
log i
cabins i
; c
because c
maybe c
is i
more c
interesting c
to c
share c
with c
other c
people c
. c

In i
other c
hand c
you c
ask i
me c
I c
have c
the c
chance c
for i
to c
choose c
two c
activities c
while c
I c
am c
at c
the c
camp c
. c
but i
is i
no i
easy c
, c
because c
all c
is i
very c
interesting c
for c
me c
. c

But c
anyway c
I i
like c
more c
to c
have c
the c
possibilities c
for c
practice i
climbing c
and c
surfing c
. c

Meanwhile i
, c
these c
activities c
are c
develop c
. c

Can c
you c
said i
me c
if c
is i
necessary c
to c
bring c
special i
clothes c
, i
I i
refer c
for c
instance c
if c
I c
practice i
surfing c
I i
need c
water i
suit c
. c

Is c
possible i
to c
get c
there i
? c

At i
the c
same c
situation c
for c
climbing c
I i
need c
special i
equipment c
and c

Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

I c
think c
this c
topic c
is c
so c
exciting c
in i
the c
antropological i
and c
psicological i
point c
of c
view c
, c
because c
we c
can c
studie i
the c
reaction i
before c
, c
during c
and c
after c
to i
shopping c
. c

People c
in c
general c
have c
a c
compulsory i
actitud i
for i
shopping i
in i
my c
opinion c
. c

Because c
sometimes c
the c
article c
for i
to i
buy c
is c
not c
really c
necessary c
. c
We c
must c
to i
accept c
that c
media i
have c
so i
important c
effect c
in i
our c
life i
in i
special c
the c
T.V. c

For c
the i
men c
and c
women c
is i
important c
the c
appearance c
and c
they c
spent i
a c
lot c
of c
money c
in i
buy i
clothes c
, c
cosmetic i
, c
accesories i
, c
jewels i
etc c
. c

And c
the i
other c
they i
choose i
sometimes c
just c
for c
the c
label c
. c

Without c
give c
really c
importance c
to c
the c
calidad i
in i
reference c
to c
the c
appearance c
there c
is c
more c
preocupation c
in c
the c
food c
area c
, c
because c
people c
in c
general c
they i
do c
n't c
spent i
the i
time c
for i
prepare i
food c
and c
when c
they c
shopping i
they c
choose c
pre c
- c
prepared c
food c
. c

We c
know c
is i
more i
easy c
for c
these i
busy i
life c
. c

In i
the c
other c
hand c
the c
facilities c
for c
access c
to c
mall i
center c
is i
not c
good c
. c

The c
area c
for c
parking c
, c
space c
for c
play i
grown c
to c
the c
children c
or c
bus c
station c
near c
the c
mall c
is i
not c
really c
appropiate i
. c

Otherwise c
shopping c
will i
be c
more c
enjoyable c
. c

I c
think c
in c
the c
nearly i
future c
we c
need c
to c
decide c
with c
the c
goverment i
. i

which c
is i
special c
place c
in c
the c
town c
we i
lefet i
just c
for i
comerical i
area c
, c
but c
of c
course c
with c
all c
the c
facilities c
to c
get c
there c
like i
a c
big c
supermarket c
, i
and c
mall c
centre c
in i
different c
areas c
of c
the c
city c

A c
MUSICAL c
SHOW i

TAKING c
PART i
IN i
THE c
CIRCLE c

IN c
A c
NEWSPAPER c

IT c
SAID c
: c

. c

BUT c
, c
WHEN c
I c
WAS c
WATCHING c
THE c
PLAY c
, c
I c
REALISED c
THAT c
THERE i
WAS c
A c
DIFFERENT c
ACTOR c
AND c
, c
REALLY c
, c
I c
WAS c
DISAPPOINTED c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show i
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
, c
that i
I c
went c
to c
see c
on c
the c
16th c
of c
June c
. c

Firstly c
, c
the c
actor c
suppossed i
to c
be c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
but c
he c
was c
not c
, c
it c
was c
another c
actor c
, c
who c
I c
have c
never c
seen c
before c
, c
so c
, c
as c
you c
can c
imagen i
, c
I c
was c
very c
disappointed c
. c

Another c
complain i
is c
about c
the c
time c
that c
the c
musical i
show c
started c
, i
the c
advertisement c
said c
it c
started c
at c
19:30 c
, c
but c
it c
did c
not c
, i
we c
had c
to c
wait c
45 c
minutes c
. c

It c
was c
terrible c
. c

Now c
, c
about c
the c
tickets c
, c
the i
were c
different c
prices c
but c
there c
were c
not i
discounts c
, c
and c
because c
of c
this c
, c
many c
people c
could c
not c
see c
the c
show c
, c
especially c
students c
. c

Finally c
, c
when c
the c
musical i
show c
finished c
, c
and c
I c
have c
to c
say c
, c
a c
bit c
late c
, c
I c
went c
to c
the c
theatre c
's c
restaurant c
to c
eat c
something c
but c
this c
place c
was c
closed c
because c
the c
chef c
had c
already c
gone c
. c

At i
is i
explain i
it i
was c
not c
the c
perfect c
evening c
that c
I c
expected c
to c
have c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
have c
my c
money c
back c
because i
of c
the c
reasons c
that c
I c
mentioned c
before i
. c

Looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Pat c
, c
Maria c
's c
best c
friend c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
, c
so c
Maria c
was c
very c
disappointed c
when c
she c
realised c
that c
Manuel c
knew c
the c
truth c
about c
the c
feelings c
that c
Maria c
had c
for c
him c
, c
in c
fact c
, c
she c
was c
so c
angry c
she c
almost i
kill c
but i
, c
she c
could c
n't c
because c
Pat c
was c
her c
best c
friend c
. c

Maria c
talked c
to c
Pat c
about c
the c
stupid c
thing c
that c
she c
did i
, c
but c
Pat c
refused c
to c
apologaising i
to c
her c
, c
because c
she c
felt c
it c
was c
n't c
a c
mistake c
and c
she c
did c
it c
for c
only c
one c
reason c
: c
help i
Maria c
to c
get c
the c
man c
that c
she c
loved c
. c

Maria c
was c
speechless c
, c
it c
was c
the c
first c
time c
that c
she c
did c
n't c
know c
what c
to c
do c
, c
so c
she c
decided c
to c
stop c
talking c
to c
Pat c
. c

After c
3 c
weeks c
, c
Maria c
got c
ill c
so c
she c
was c
not c
available i
to c
go c
to c
school c
. c

Some i
friends i
phoned c
her c
everyday i
, c
except c
Pat c
, c
the c
only c
friend c
that c
Maria c
really c
loved c
, i
despite c
that c
, c
she c
was c
not c
sad c
. c

One c
day c
, c
when c
Maria c
was c
seating i
in c
her c
bedroom c
, c
someone c
knock i
the i
door c
, i
it c
was c
Manuel c
, i
he c
was c
worried c
for i
her c
. c

Maria c
was c
nervous c
, c
but c
for i
the c
first c
time c
, c
she c
could c
talk c
to c
him c
as c
she c
never c
did i
before c
, c
and c
at c
the c
end c
of c
the c
day c
, c
she c
was c
the c
happiest c
person c
of i
the c
world c
, i
she c
gave i
her c
first c
kiss c
and c
she c
had c
Pat c
's c
friendship c
back c
, i
after c
all c
, c
everything c
happened c
because c
of c
her c
. c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

First c
of c
all c
, c
we c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
very c
much c
for c
organising c
such c
a c
wonderfull i
trip c
with c
an c
interesting c
program i
. c

We c
are c
all c
extremely c
excited c
especially i
because c
of c
the c
trip c
to c
Greenwich c
, c
the c
town c
we c
were i
always c
interested c
in c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
may i
other c
interesting c
places c
and c
exhibitions c
to c
see c
in c
London c
. c

For c
example c
, c
in i
the c
time c
of c
our c
visit c
there c
is c
going c
to c
be c
" c
The c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
" c
. c

It c
is c
a c
coinsidence i
which c
we c
would c
be c
extremely c
happy c
to c
take c
advantage c
on i
. c

This c
is c
a c
great c
opportunity c
for c
us c
to c
see c
the c
latest c
fashions c
and c
famous c
fashion c
models c
who c
we c
would c
like c
to c
have c
authograps i
from c
. c

We c
hope c
changing c
the c
excursion c
program i
a c
little c
will c
not c
cause c
any c
problems c
. c

Our c
suggestion c
is c
to c
visit c
Science i
Museum c
on c
Wednesday c
afternoon c
instead c
of c
Tuesday c
. c

Because c
the c
fashion c
show c
lasts c
a c
whole c
day c
long i
. c

We c
are c
ready c
to c
give c
up c
our c
shopping c
and c
Free i
time c
. c

The c
show c
starts c
on c
14th c
March c
at c
10.00 c
and c
ends c
at c
19.00 c
the c
same c
day c
. c

We c
are c
sorry c
for c
any c
inconvenience c
caused c
by c
our c
request c
. c

Yours c
faithfully i

Famous c
people c
are c
living c
creatures c
. c

They c
breathe c
, c
eat c
, c
feel c
and c
beside i
that i
they c
are c
famous c
they c
are c
just c
the c
same c
as c
anyone c
else c
. c

Nobody c
likes c
to c
be c
observed c
constantly c
or c
touched c
by c
strangers c
and c
pointed c
out c
in c
the c
streets c
with c
no c
right c
even c
or i
just c
a c
little c
privacy c
. c

I c
personally c
think c
the c
best c
would i
be c
to c
put c
the c
celebrities c
in c
cages c
and c
let c
people c
touch c
them c
, c
point c
and c
ask c
for c
authopraps i
. c

Like c
in c
the c
zoo c
. c

The c
biggest c
commercial c
gain i
in c
history c
I i
believe c
, c
but c
celebrities c
are c
not c
animals c
although c
they c
may c
be c
sometimes c
treated c
the c
same c
way c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
they c
must c
have c
done c
something c
to c
become c
famous c
. c

It c
may c
in i
many c
cases c
, c
not c
be c
true c
but c
we c
can c
suspect c
that c
most c
of c
them c
wanted c
to c
become c
a c
celebrity c
and c
they c
had c
to c
know c
there c
is c
no c
private c
life c
unseparately c
contected i
to c
it c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
everyone c
has c
the c
right c
to c
keep i
privacy i
of c
their c
own c
homes c
and c
even c
someone c
extremely c
famous c
deserve i
to c
have c
a c
private c
life c
. c

Unfortunately c
as c
long c
as c
their c
private c
life c
is c
interesting c
for c
ordinary c
people c
and c
it c
brings c
commercial c
gain c
to c
publishers c
, c
journalists c
and c
photographers c
, c
famous c
people c
will c
just c
have c
to c
get c
use i
to c
this c
living c
" c
under c
a c
microscope c
" c
. c

Dear c
Jane c
Clark c
, c

The c
purpose c
of c
this c
letter c
is c
to c
congratulate c
you c
on c
the c
International c
Arts c
Fesival i
I c
attended c
last c
weekend c
. c

I c
believe c
that c
the c
event c
was c
good c
, i
however c
I i
feel c
that c
the c
festival c
can i
be c
improved c
next c
year c
. c

Firstly c
I i
would c
like c
to c
tell c
you c
that c
the c
idea c
of c
organizing c
an c
International c
Arts c
Festival c
is c
fantastic c
, c
but c
in c
your c
advertisement c
it c
was i
said c
that c
I c
would c
find c
stars c
and c
artists c
from c
arround i
the c
world c
, c
when c
, c
in c
fact c
, c
they c
were c
from c
only c
six c
countries c
. c

I c
do c
understand c
that c
it c
must c
be c
difficult c
to c
get c
these c
people c
to c
go i
to c
the c
festival c
, c
but c
it c
would c
be c
nice c
if c
next c
year c
we c
could c
meet c
other i
personalities c
. c

Secondly c
I i
belive i
you c
should c
know c
that c
a c
lot c
of c
people c
, c
including c
me c
, c
were c
not c
able c
to c
enjoy c
concerts i
because c
some c
concert c
halls c
were c
too c
small c
. c

I c
would c
be c
very c
thankful i
if c
you c
could c
tell c
me c
if c
there c
will c
be c
more c
plays c
and c
films c
next c
year c
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
I i
would c
like c
you c
to c
know c
that c
I c
think c
the c
idea c
of c
the c
weekend c
ticket c
for c
all c
events c
was c
excellent c
because c
in c
the c
end c
it c
was c
cheaper c
than c
paying c
for c
each c
event c
separatelly i
. c

I c
hope c
you c
find c
my c
opinion i
useful c
. c

Once c
again c
congratulations i
on c
the c
Festival c
. c

I c
hope c
to c
hearing i
from c
you c
soon c

yours i
sincerelly i
, c

tips i
to i
earn c
money c

When c
the c
holidays c
began i
everybody c
is c
happy c
because c
it c
represents c
the c
beginning c
of c
a c
time c
full c
of c
fun c
and c
lots c
of c
interesting c
things c
to c
do c
, c
but c
in c
order c
to c
do c
these c
things c
we c
all c
need c
money c
and c
that c
is c
a c
big c
problem c
to i
most c
of c
us c
. c

there i
are c
several c
ways c
to c
earn c
a c
bit c
of c
money c
in c
your c
spare c
time c
. c

One c
of c
the c
most c
common c
examples c
is c
baby- i
sitting c
taking i
care c
of c
little c
children c
is c
easy c
and c
it c
does c
n't c
require c
special c
skills c
, i
all c
you c
need c
is c
a c
lot c
of c
patience c
. c

If c
looking c
after c
children c
does c
n't c
fit i
you c
, c
you c
can c
try c
with i
pets c
. c

Lots c
of c
people c
would c
pay c
you c
to c
take c
their c
dog c
for c
a c
walk c
. c

So c
if c
you c
like c
animals c
this c
is c
your c
chance c
to c
earn c
money i
and c
have c
fun c
at c
the c
same c
time c
. c

Another c
option c
is c
to c
wash c
your c
neighbour c
's c
car c
. c

In c
this c
case c
you c
need c
to c
buy c
the c
materials c
you c
will c
work c
with c
, c
but c
do c
n't c
worry c
, c
soap c
is c
not c
very c
expensive c
. c

the i
most c
important c
thing c
is c
that c
you c
wisely i
choose c
the c
most c
suitable c
work c
for c
you c
, c
according c
to c
the c
things c
you c
like c
to c
do c
. c

If c
you c
do c
n't c
find c
anything c
good c
enough c
for c
you c
do c
n't c
worry c
, c
you c
should c
always c
remember c
: c
It c
's c
not c
all c
about c
the c
money c
! c

To c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

Firstly c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
the c
programme c
that c
you c
provided i
. c

It c
was i
very i
good c
programme c
, c
especially c
the c
river c
trip c
to c
Greenwich c
, c
which c
I c
am c
sure c
the c
whole c
class c
would i
enjoy c
. c

However c
, c
our c
class c
has c
spotted c
an c
advertisement c
for c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
and c
would i
all c
wish c
to c
attend c
. c

It c
will c
be c
held c
at c
the c
Central c
Exhibition c
Hall c
in c
London c
on c
the c
14th c
March c
. c

It c
will c
be c
from c
10.00 c
till c
7.00pm c
. c

The c
show c
will c
be c
about c
all c
the c
latest c
fashion i
, c
leisure c
and c
sports c
wear c
, c
make c
up i
and c
hairstyles c
. c

We c
would c
also c
not c
have c
to c
worry c
financially c
as c
it c
is c
free c
for c
students c
. c

This c
will c
be c
a c
great c
opportunity c
for c
us c
because c
we c
will c
be c
able c
to c
find c
out c
more c
about c
the c
people c
of c
London c
and c
their c
fashions c
and c
style c
we i
might c
also c
get c
a c
change i
to c
meet c
new c
people c
and c
interest i
with c
them c
. c

The c
whole c
class c
is c
also c
very c
excited c
about c
this c
fashion c
show c
and c
would c
really c
appreciate c
your c
giving c
them c
a c
change i
to c
go c
. c

I c
have c
a c
few c
suggestion i
on c
how c
the c
programme c
could c
be c
changed c
to c
fit c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
in c
. c

We c
could c
do c
as c
planned c
for c
Monday c
and c
move c
going c
to c
the c
Science c
Museum c
from c
Tuesday c
to c
Wednesday c
afternoon c
. c

We c
would c
have c
to c
forgo c
the c
shopping c
as c
we c
might c
not c
have c
enough c
time c
and c
the c
exchange c
rate c
might c
be c
too c
high c
for c
us c
to c
do c
much c
shopping c
. c

We c
can c
however i
go i
and c
look c
around c
the c
shopping c
mall c
if c
we c
have c
time c
after c
the c
show c
. c

Lastly c
, c
I c
would c
be c
very c
grateful c
if c
you c
could c
give c
us c
your c
permission c
to c
go c
to c
the c
show c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
would i
consider c
this c
matter c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Everyday i
, c
something c
changes c
and c
we c
become c
more c
modern c
companies i
use c
computers c
instead c
of c
books c
, c
dentist i
use c
modernized c
electrical i
item i
instead c
of c
just c
a c
plier i
, i
even c
homes c
are c
effected i
. c

From c
letters c
to c
emails c
, c
from c
gas c
stoves c
to c
electric c
stoves c
and c
microwaves c
, i
but c
we c
are c
n't c
just c
going c
to c
stop c
here c
are c
we c
? c

No c
, c
in c
the c
future c
, c
the c
present c
will c
be c
the c
past c
and c
these i
things c
now c
new c
to c
use i
will c
be c
old c
, c
outdated c
and c
changed c
. c

I c
see c
a c
very c
different c
home c
for c
us c
in c
the c
future c
. c

Most c
things c
will c
be c
computerised c
. c

We c
might c
even c
be c
using c
voice c
identification c
and c
fingerprints c
instead c
of c
keys c
. c

We c
an i
on c
and c
off c
lights c
with c
touch c
pads c
and c
remote c
controllers i
. c

We c
might c
even c
be c
able c
to c
open c
the c
door c
without c
getting i
out c
from i
the c
living c
room c
. c

Cameras c
will c
be c
something c
usual c
in c
every c
house c
instead c
of c
that c
little c
peephole c
in c
your c
door c
. c

Although c
all c
that c
may c
change i
our c
houses c
may c
be c
still c
the c
same c
. c

The c
rooms c
and c
size i
should c
remain c
as c
it i
was i
and c
the c
living c
rooms c
and c
all i
may c
still c
be c
decorated c
in c
the c
same c
style c
. c

We c
might c
still c
favour i
that c
old c
carpet c
and c
couch c
. c

The c
furniture c
should c
not c
change c
that c
much c
on c
the c
outside c
and c
the c
amount i
of c
rooms c
should c
not c
change c
too i
. c

In c
the c
future c
, c
every c
child c
might c
have c
a c
laptop c
. c

And c
instead c
of c
going c
to c
school c
, c
why c
not c
let c
school c
come c
to c
you c
? c
We c
will c
be c
learning c
at c
home c
using c
computers c
and c
disc i
. c

Never i
have c
to c
leave c
the c
house c
or c
wake c
up c
so c
early c
. c

Another c
way c
our c
home c
could c
be c
different c
in c
the c
future c
is c
probably c
the c
utilitles i
we c
are i
using c
. c

We c
might c
not c
need c
maids c
to c
do c
housework c
anymore c
as c
they c
can c
easily c
be c
replaced c
with c
a c
robot c
, c
a c
machine c
, c
or c
something c
other i
with c
the c
same c
purpose c
. c

Our c
homes c
will c
still c
be c
the c
same c
in c
terms c
of c
the c
kitchen i
, i
it c
will c
still c
be c
filled c
with c
vegetables c
and c
meat c
. c

This c
is c
because c
people c
wo c
n't c
miss i
the c
great c
taste c
of c
food c
although i
it c
could c
be c
subsituted i
to i
a c
vitamin c
pill c
or c
two c
. c

Lastly c
, c
I c
think c
that c
all c
this i
changes c
wo c
n't c
really c
be c
noticed c
as c
we c
change c
it i
daily c
and c
slowly c
instead c
abruptedly i
. c

People c
will c
be c
able c
to c
adjust c
and c
change c
with c
the c
times c
. c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

On c
behalf c
of c
our c
class c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
some c
information c
about c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
show c
, i
that c
we c
saw c
advertised c
and c
we c
are c
interested c
indeed i
. c

In c
addition c
we c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
about i
the c
programme c
. c

Firstly c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
some c
details c
about c
this c
show c
. c

It c
will c
take c
place c
in c
Central i
Exhibition c
Hall c
, c
in c
London c
, c
on c
Tuesday c
14th i
of c
March c
and c
the i
suitable c
time c
will c
be c
10.00 c
- c
19.00 c

I c
would c
like c
to c
mention c
that c
this i
day c
we c
are c
going c
to c
visit c
the c
Science c
Museum c
in c
the c
morning c
and c
after c
we c
are c
going c
for i
shopping c
, c
so c
I c
believe c
it c
will c
be c
a c
good c
change i
for c
all c
of c
us c
to c
attend c
this c
show c
as c
it c
is c
free c
for c
students c
! c

The c
most c
important c
thing c
is c
that c
the c
time c
that c
the c
show c
starts c
is c
perfect c
and c
is c
suitable i
as c
well c
with c
our c
programme c
because c
until i
19:00 c
I c
think c
that c
everyone c
will c
have c
finished c
their c
shopping c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
more c
details c
about c
the c
show c
and c
particularly c
what i
does i
it c
include i
. c

The c
latest c
fashion i
will c
be c
on c
show c
and c
also c
the c
Leisure c
and c
sports c
wear c
. c
Really c
interesting c
! c

Moreover c
all i
about c
the c
make c
up c
and c
the c
hairstyles c
. c
I c
think c
that c
it i
will c
be c
a c
great c
opportunity c
to c
all c
of c
us c
to c
be c
on c
this c
show c
while c
we c
are c
going i
to c
be c
in c
London c
. c

But c
, i
if c
there c
is c
a c
problem c
that i
the c
show c
is c
on c
Tuesday c
afternoon c
, c
the c
same c
hour i
with i
shopping i
, c
I c
suggest c
having i
the i
shopping c
on c
Wednesday c
afternoon c
that i
we c
will c
not c
have c
anything c
to c
do c
! c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
your c
reply c
, c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Some c
people c
think c
that c
to i
be c
a c
famous c
person c
is c
very i
excuiting i
thing c
, c
that c
all c
the c
time c
this c
makes c
you c
feel c
completely i
and c
also c
they c
think c
that c
if c
you c
are c
famous c
you c
are c
special c
as c
well c
. c

I c
believe c
, i
that c
if c
somebody c
wants c
the i
fame c
and c
the i
glory c
must i
be c
tottally i
sure i
about c
the c
results c
. c

For c
example c
, c
the i
politicians c
the i
have c
choosed i
their c
careers c
, i
they c
must c
know c
that c
they i
are c
going c
to c
involved c
with c
everything c
that c
it c
has c
to c
do c
with c
publicity c
and c
their c
country c
and c
the c
most c
important c
is i
that c
they c
have c
to c
realize c
that c
they c
should c
be c
extremely c
careful c
of i
their c
movements c
or c
else c
they c
are c
going c
to c
have c
bad i
reputation c
, c
and c
they c
will c
be i
not c
trustworthy i
. c

Another c
succesfull i
carreer i
such c
as c
, c
film c
stars c
must c
also c
be c
balanced c
. c

If c
somebody c
is c
a c
film c
star c
this c
mean i
that c
has i
got c
a c
different c
kind c
of c
life c
, c
more i
comfortable c
, c
more c
interesting c
but i
it c
does c
n't c
mean c
that c
he c
or c
she c
ca c
n't c
be c
like c
normal c
people c
even c
if c
he c
or c
she c
is c
a c
star c
. c

If c
somebody c
wants c
to c
be c
famous c
of c
cource i
must i
be c
on i
the c
top c
and c
the c
mass c
media c
will c
be c
following c
him c
or c
her c
. c

But c
I c
think c
that c
the i
are c
limits c
. c

Everybody c
deserve i
to c
have c
a c
private c
life c
even c
if c
he c
is c
a c
plumber c
or c
even c
if c
she c
is c
a c
famous c
singer c
. c

It c
does c
n't c
matter c
what c
kind c
of c
carreer i
or c
job c
you c
are i
follow c
. c

You c
must c
control c
your c
behaviour c
and c
try c
not c
implove i
so c
much c
yourself c
. c

And c
finally c
the c
journalists c
the i
should c
know c
how c
to c
respect c
the c
private c
life i
of c
everyone c
and c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

Firstly c
, c
I c
'm c
writing c
to c
thank c
you c
the i
great c
opportunity c
you c
give i
us c
, c
especially c
in c
planing i
all c
this c
programme c
in c
a i
such c
acurate i
way c
. c

I c
think c
that c
this c
programme c
has i
a i
good i
organisation c
, c
as c
you c
know c
, c
due i
to c
we c
have c
enough c
time c
to c
visit c
plenty c
of c
local c
interest c
points c
. c

But c
, i
I c
was c
wondering c
, c
like i
a c
student c
of c
this c
college c
, c
if c
we c
would i
change c
part c
of c
this c
programme c
... c
we c
'd c
like c
to c
go c
to c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
. c

It c
takes c
place c
on c
Tuesday c
14th c
and c
begins c
at c
ten c
o'clock c
. c

In c
this c
way c
, c
we c
can c
go c
to c
visit c
the c
Science c
Museum c
earlier c
in c
the c
morning c
and c
the i
, i
we c
can c
go c
to c
the c
show c
. c

Front i
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
we c
are c
very c
interested c
in c
the c
latest c
fashions c
like c
the i
leisure c
, i
sports i
wear c
, c
make c
up i
, c
hairstyles c
, c
you c
know c
... c
I c
strongly c
believe c
that c
we c
will c
be c
at i
the c
right c
time c
and c
best c
city c
to c
appreciate c
it c
. c

Please c
let c
me c
know c
if c
you c
are i
agree c
with c
us c
! c

Oh c
I c
forgot c
about c
it i
! c

Besides i
, c
this c
show c
is c
gree i
( c
another c
positiu i
point c
) c
. c

Looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

FANCY c
GETTING c
TO c
KNOW c
THE c
FUTURE c
? c

Do c
you c
think c
you c
've c
the i
future c
in c
your c
hands c
? c

Do c
you c
think c
we c
're c
living c
like c
old i
times c
? c

Would c
you c
like c
living i
in c
a c
modern c
way c
? c

What c
do c
you c
expect c
about i
the c
future c
? c

Can c
you c
compare c
it c
... c
? c

Are c
you c
afraid c
? c

Well c
, c
you c
can c
look c
at c
your c
house c
... c

Nowadays c
, c
we c
have c
all c
kind i
of c
instruments c
to i
washing c
up c
the c
dishes c
, c
to i
cook c
to c
be c
more c
comfortable i
, c
for c
example c
the i
TV c
, c
the c
video c
recorder c
, c
etc c
. c

Maybe c
, c
in c
a c
few c
years c
later i
we c
'll c
have c
a c
bigger c
TV c
, c
a c
more c
suitable c
radio c
but c
, c
from i
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
I c
think c
these c
facts c
will c
not c
change c
the i
way c
of c
our i
lifes i
. c
We c
will c
be c
able c
to c
accelerate i
the c
process i
of c
the i
computer c
's i
games c
for i
example c
... c

But c
not c
in c
the i
strange c
way c
you c
can c
imagine c
... c

I c
mean c
I c
do c
n't c
think c
we c
'll c
change c
cars c
by i
aereoplanes i
... c

In i
this c
way c
, c
you c
have c
to c
be c
calm c
because c
as i
you c
know c
the i
things c
are c
developing c
in i
the c
same c
way c
you'r i
changing c
, c
too c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
I c
strongly c
believe c
that c
the i
the c
house c
of c
the c
future c
will c
be c
the c
house c
of c
a c
new c
mindness i
it i
will c
be c
a c
very c
positiu i
point c
for c
opening c
our i
lifes i
. c

So c
, c
we c
have c
the c
future c
in c
our c
hands c
! c

Think c
about c
it c
. c

Dear c
Principal c
, c
First c
of c
all c
, c
we c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
good i
programme c
which c
provides c
us c
3 i
days c
stay i
in c
London c
. c

It c
contains c
a c
wide c
range c
of c
activities c
for i
example c
, c
sightseeing c
, c
river i
trip c
, c
visiting c
science i
museum c
and c
gallery c
, c
shopping c
. c

It c
is c
certain c
that c
the c
programme c
will c
give c
the c
students c
considerable c
enjoyment c
. c

However c
, c
we c
have c
found c
an c
advertisement c
for c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
show c
, c
which c
will c
be c
held c
at c
Central c
Exhibition c
Hall c
on c
14th c
of c
March c
. c

The c
advertisement c
says c
that c
the c
show c
is c
full c
of c
many c
interesting c
programmes c
, c
such c
as c
the c
latest c
fashions c
, c
leisure c
and c
sports c
wear c
, c
make c
up i
and c
hairstyles c
etc c
. c

Moreover c
, c
students c
are c
allowed c
to c
admit i
for c
free c
. c

All c
of c
us c
would c
like c
to c
attend c
the c
show c
because c
young c
people c
, c
particularly c
girls c
are i
interested c
in c
fashion c
and c
make c
up i
, c
so c
we c
are c
expecting c
the c
show c
will i
be c
the i
great c
opportunity c
to c
see c
what c
the c
new c
trend i
in c
fashion c
will c
be c
like c
. c

It c
would c
be c
grateful i
if c
you c
give i
a c
little c
change c
in c
programme i
so c
that c
we c
are c
able c
to c
attend c
the c
show c
. c

It c
seems c
to c
be c
good c
to c
change c
the c
programme c
of c
14th c
into i
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
show c
, c
instead c
of c
the c
science c
museum c
and c
shopping c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Technical c
and c
Warm c
Home c
People c
's c
way c
of c
life c
has c
considerably i
been c
changed c
by c
rapdily i
developing c
mordern i
technology c
. c

To c
begin c
with c
, c
it c
will c
be c
good c
to c
look c
back c
on c
how c
our c
parents c
have c
lived c
in c
a c
house c
. c

50 c
years c
ago c
, c
Korean c
mothers c
should c
have c
made c
a c
fire c
by c
burning c
woods i
to c
warm c
a c
room c
up c
and c
make c
food c
. c

Since c
the c
eletric i
fire c
and c
microwave c
oven c
had c
been c
invented c
, c
their c
life i
have c
been c
far c
easier c
than c
before c
. c

Today c
, c
however c
, c
people c
do c
not c
need c
to c
spend c
many i
times i
on c
making c
food c
, c
washing c
up c
, c
or c
even c
on c
turning c
on i
an c
off c
the c
light c
. c

Machines c
, c
such c
as c
a i
dish i
washer c
, c
laundry i
machine c
and c
remote c
controller i
help c
us c
jut i
to c
relax c
or c
do c
a c
little c
work i
necessary c
. c

From i
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
people c
's c
home i
in c
the c
future c
will c
be c
controlled c
by c
a c
computer c
which c
is c
devised i
in i
every c
machine c
, c
TV c
, c
cooker c
and c
the c
light c
, c
connecting i
to c
the c
owner c
. c

He c
/ c
she c
can c
just c
press c
the c
button c
or c
send c
e c
- c
mail c
to c
operate c
what c
he c
/ c
she c
needs c
, c
even c
though c
the c
owner c
is c
far c
from c
the c
house c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
people c
will c
still c
be c
living c
in c
a c
building c
which c
is c
constructed c
for c
a c
" c
family c
" c
. c

In c
spite c
of c
the c
computer c
, c
children c
will c
need c
food c
their c
mothers c
make c
and c
love c
expressed c
not c
by c
a c
computer c
, c
but c
by c
parents c
themselves c
. c

Computer i
might c
know c
better i
than c
human i
, c
but c
there c
are c
many c
things c
which c
it c
can c
not c
replace c
in c
our c
life c
. c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c
, c

I c
was c
enthusiatic i
about c
receiving c
your c
letter c
. c
I c
will c
give c
you c
all c
the c
necessary c
information c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
because c
during c
that c
period c
I c
will c
be c
free c
from c
work c
, i
my c
current c
post c
finishes c
at c
the c
end c
of c
June c
but c
I c
will c
start c
another c
job c
at c
the c
beginning c
of c
August c
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
to c
stay c
in c
tents i
rather c
than c
in c
log i
cabins i
, c
because c
it c
would c
be c
a c
new c
experience c
for c
me c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
try c
something c
different c
. c

As c
far c
as c
the c
activities c
are c
concerned c
, c
I c
have c
chosen c
to c
do c
Tennis i
and c
Swimming c
. c

I c
am c
good c
at c
playing c
Tennis i
and c
I c
have c
been c
learning c
to c
swim c
for c
three c
months c
so c
it c
could c
be c
a i
useful c
training c
for c
me c
. c

Moreover c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
are c
the c
best c
for c
living c
in c
the c
camp c
and c
if c
I c
need c
to c
bring c
with c
me c
a c
large c
amount c
of c
money c
. c

I c
want c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
this c
prize c
, i
let c
me c
know c
if c
you c
need c
further c
information c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Bianca c
Botticelli c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

In c
your c
last c
letter c
you c
asked c
me c
about c
the c
concert c
... c
oh c
it c
was c
fantastic c
! c

I c
've c
always c
loved c
music c
so c
working c
in i
a c
concert c
was c
great c
. c

You c
ca c
n't c
imagine c
how c
many c
people c
are c
involved c
in c
the c
organization c
of c
a c
concert c
, i
apart c
from c
the c
musicists i
and c
the c
singers c
, c
there c
are c
people c
who c
work c
with c
lights c
, c
who c
organize c
the c
security c
service i
... c
it c
was c
so c
exciting c
! c

My c
work c
consisted c
in c
checking c
the c
tickets c
, c
the i
number c
on c
them c
and c
taking c
the i
people c
to c
their c
seats c
. c

It c
was c
also c
very c
tiring c
because c
all c
the c
people c
arrived c
at c
the c
same c
time c
and c
they c
did c
n't c
want c
to c
wait c
for c
my c
help c
; c
so c
they c
went c
around c
the c
theatre c
, c
looking c
for c
their c
seats c
and c
making c
so c
much c
noise c
. c

Sometimes c
I c
think c
that c
people c
never c
grow c
up c
, i
if c
they c
had c
been c
a c
class c
of c
children c
, c
they c
would c
have c
made c
less c
noise c
! c
! c

Anyway c
, c
it c
was c
a c
great c
experience c
in c
spite c
of c
these c
little c
problems c
. c

Now c
I c
have c
to c
go c
, i
write c
soon c
and c
let c
me c
know c
what c
you c
have c
been c
doing c
. c

Lots c
of c
love c

Bianca c

Dear c
Helen c
: c

I c
've c
recived i
your c
letter c
and c
I c
am c
pleased c
to c
have c
won c
because c
I c
needed c
some c
days c
to c
relax c
myself i
and c
to c
leave c
the c
city c
, c
which c
is c
very c
extressing i
. c

I c
only i
can c
travel c
on c
July c
because c
I c
am c
working c
in c
an c
office c
and c
I c
must c
ask c
my c
boss c
for c
a c
holiday c
and c
it c
's c
the c
mounth i
he c
can c
give c
me c
, i
so c
I c
hope c
it i
is c
n't c
a c
problem c
for c
you c
. c

To i
spend c
the c
two c
weeks c
I c
would c
prefer c
to i
live c
in c
tents i
, c
that c
's c
in i
my c
opinion c
a i
way c
to c
be c
nearer c
the c
enviroment i
and c
the c
animals c
, c
although c
I c
do c
n't c
mind c
living i
in c
log c
cabins c
. c

In c
spite c
of c
liking c
all c
the c
sports c
you c
wrote c
in i
your c
letter c
I i
am c
only c
good c
at c
climbing c
and c
sailing c
, c
because c
I c
am i
used c
to c
practise i
them c
with c
my c
father c
since i
I c
was c
a c
child c
. c

I c
have c
got c
a c
doubt c
, c
it c
is c
not c
very c
important c
, c
but c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
if c
I c
need c
any c
money c
or c
all i
is c
payed i
, i
the c
kind c
of c
clothes c
I c
should c
wear c
, c
if c
the c
weather c
is c
good c
or c
bad c
... c
and c
all c
the c
extra c
information c
you c
can c
send c
me c
. c

Thank c
you c
very c
much c
for c
the c
prize c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
. c

Eliza c
Vasquez c

Why c
people i
like c
so i
much c
go c
shopping c
? c

In c
my c
opinion c
the c
majority c
of c
the i
people c
that i
go c
shopping c
are c
women c
who c
must c
buy c
food c
and c
other c
kind i
of c
things c
for c
her i
family i
, c
so c
for i
them c
, c
shopping c
is c
a c
very c
boring c
activity c
that c
is c
repeated c
everyday i
and c
that c
drive i
them c
crazy c
when c
they c
have c
to c
choose c
the c
best c
product c
and c
the c
cheapest c
price c
to c
save c
some c
money c
. c

Othrewise i
, c
there c
are c
people c
who c
think c
the c
opposite c
; i
such c
as c
: c
children c
, c
teenagers c
, c
men c
; c
but c
not c
always c
, c
because c
they c
go i
to c
buy c
hardly c
ever c
, i
only c
when c
they c
need c
clothes c
or i
something c
for c
their c
job c
or c
school c
. c

In c
that c
way c
shopping c
can c
be c
as c
funny i
as c
you c
want c
, c
although c
if c
you c
do c
it c
very c
often c
, c
it c
will c
be i
as c
an c
obligation c
in c
the c
future c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
, c
all i
you c
make i
in c
small c
cuantities i
is c
good c
and c
funny i
, c
but c
do c
n't c
encrease i
them i
if c
you c
do c
n't c
want c
to c
feel c
uncomfortable c
. c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c

Thank c
you c
for c
your c
letter c
. c

I c
was c
so c
happy c
to c
hear c
that c
I c
have c
won c
a c
two c
weeks i
holiday c
in c
the c
U.S.A. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
. c
I c
am c
going c
to c
finish c
my c
exams c
in c
June c
, c
and c
I c
am c
planning c
to c
go c
back c
to c
China c
in c
early c
August c
. c

So c
if c
I c
could c
travel c
in c
July c
, c
and c
coming i
back c
before c
6th i
of c
August c
, c
that c
would c
be c
great c
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
living i
in c
tents c
to c
log c
cabins c
. c

I c
have c
never c
had c
any c
experience c
to i
live c
in c
a c
tent c
, c
so c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
it c
a c
go c
. c

I c
think c
I c
will c
enjoy c
myself c
in c
a c
tent c
. c

I c
love c
swimming c
, c
but c
I c
am c
not c
any c
good c
at c
swimming c
. c

I c
really c
wanted i
to c
learn c
how c
to c
swim c
. c

I c
was c
wondering c
if c
there c
is c
a c
coach c
could i
give c
us i
a c
lesson c
during i
the c
Camp c
. c

Also c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
join c
basketball i
team c
, i
I c
used c
to c
play c
basketball c
when c
I c
was c
in c
high c
school c
, c
and c
our c
high c
school c
basketball c
team c
have i
won c
many c
competitions c
during c
last i
ten c
years c
in c
our c
city c
. c

I c
am c
glad c
I c
had i
taken c
a i
part c
in c
a c
few c
competitions c
, c
and c
I c
was c
so c
proud c
of c
our c
basketball c
team c
. c

Would c
you c
tell c
me c
that i
how c
much c
money c
you c
would i
give c
it i
to c
me c
and c
how i
is i
the c
weather c
like c
in c
U.S.A. i
Thank c
you c
for c
every i
thing c
! c

Yours c
faithfully i

Dear c
Kim c
, c

It c
was c
great c
to c
hear c
from c
you c
, c
haven't c
seen c
you c
since c
last c
summer c
holiday c
, c
hope c
everything c
is c
fine c
in i
your c
place c
. c

You c
wanted c
to c
hear c
about c
my c
experience c
at c
the c
pop c
concert c
which c
I c
enjoyed c
helping c
last i
month c
? c

I c
must c
say c
that c
was c
a i
great c
fun c
, i
I c
've i
never c
had c
this c
kind c
of c
experience c
before c
. c

Before c
the c
concert c
actually c
started c
I c
had c
to c
give c
out c
lots c
of c
leaflets c
, i
they c
are i
list i
of c
pop c
band i
and c
group i
which c
will i
appear c
in c
the c
concert c
in c
order c
, c
and c
some c
information c
about c
their c
performance c
and c
backgrounds c
. c

After c
that c
, c
I c
had c
to c
help c
people c
who c
had c
a c
ticket c
but c
ca i
n't c
find c
their c
seat c
. c

During c
the c
concert c
, c
I c
did c
n't c
have c
a c
lot c
to c
do c
, c
so c
I c
had c
chance i
to c
see c
most c
of c
the c
performance c
, i
that c
was c
excellent c
. c

I c
was c
excited c
that c
I c
had c
a c
closer c
look c
at c
so c
many c
famous c
pop c
stars c
. c

During c
break i
time c
I c
did c
give c
a c
lots i
of c
direction i
to c
people c
who c
ca i
n't c
find c
toilet i
, c
and c
information i
such c
as c
where c
they c
could c
have c
a c
cup c
of c
coffee c
. c

That c
was c
bit i
boring c
, c
but c
it c
was c
part c
of c
my c
job c
. c

I c
got i
to c
go c
. c

Write i
to c
you c
next c
time c
. c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
response c
to c
your c
letter c
about c
the c
first c
prize c
in c
the c
Competition c
. c

I c
am c
very i
looking c
forward c
to c
going c
to c
California c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
go c
in c
July c
, c
because c
I c
am c
going c
to c
have c
my c
summer c
holidays c
in c
that c
month c
. c

About c
accommodation c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
log i
cabins i
, c
because c
I c
have c
a c
problem c
in i
my c
back c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
need c
to c
sleep c
in c
a c
bed c
. c

Also c
tents c
are c
not c
fairly i
comfortable c
. c

As c
far c
as c
camp c
activities c
concerned i
, c
I c
have c
been c
doing c
windsurfing c
for c
5 c
years c
, i
for c
that c
reason c
, c
I c
am c
fairly c
interested c
in c
sailing c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
I c
keen i
on c
painting c
, c
however c
, c
I c
have c
never c
painted c
in c
my c
life c
, c
so c
I c
would c
like c
to c
try c
it c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
was c
wondering c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
I c
have c
to c
wear c
in c
California c
? c

In c
addition c
, c
could c
you c
advice i
me c
how c
much c
money c
I c
need c
for c
the c
trip c
? c
and c
is c
there c
anything c
else c
do i
I c
have c
to c
know c
? c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
Sincerely c

Hello c
Kim c
, c

I c
've i
received c
your c
letter c
two c
days c
ago c
and c
I c
'm c
quite c
happy c
to c
know c
that c
you c
passed c
F.C.E. c
I c
'm c
ok c
and c
let c
me c
tell c
you c
about c
my c
last i
experience c
. c

I c
went c
to c
Madrid c
last c
week c
and c
I c
was c
walking c
in c
the c
street c
when c
somebody c
asked c
me c
an i
address c
. c

I c
looked c
at c
him c
and c
I c
realised c
that c
this c
person c
was c
David c
Bowie c
. c

Yes c
! c
! c
! c

I c
could c
n't c
believe c
it c
. c

He c
was c
trying c
to c
speak c
in c
Spanish c
, c
but c
his c
accent c
was c
terrible c
. c

So c
, c
I c
started c
to c
speak c
in c
English c
with c
him c
. c

I c
explained c
to c
him c
where c
was i
the c
street c
that c
he c
was c
looking c
for c
and c
we c
carried c
out i
with c
the c
conversation c
for c
a c
while c
. c

I c
thought c
he c
was c
very c
rude c
, c
but c
I c
was c
wrong c
, c
he c
is c
n't c
arrogant c
at c
all c
and c
he c
looks c
very c
simply i
. c

I c
liked c
my c
experience c
with c
him c
and c
I c
think c
the c
best c
part c
was c
when c
he c
gave c
me c
his c
e c
- c
mail c
address c
. c

Yeah c
! c
! c

! c

I c
'm c
not c
joking c
, c
I c
got c
his c
e c
- c
mail c
. c

Well c
my c
friend c
, c
I c
have c
to c
go c
, c
because c
I c
got i
an c
appoinment i
with c
the c
Dentist c
. c

Write c
me i
soon c
and c
take c
care c
. c

Best c
wishes c

Dear c
Helen c
, c

I c
learnt c
from c
you i
letter c
that c
I c
've c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
. c

I c
felt c
how c
luck i
I c
was c
. c

I c
understood i
you c
want c
to c
know c
when c
am i
I c
available c
to c
set c
off c
and c
where c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
stay c
. c

First c
of c
all c
I c
will c
be c
able c
to c
go c
U.S.A i
in i
July c
because c
of c
my c
university c
. c

am c
studying c
Economics c
and c
I c
am c
very c
busy c
nowadays c
. c

My c
exams c
will c
have c
finished c

the c
end c
of c

. c

I c
will c
only c

I i
also c
will c
give c
my c
thesis c

teacher c

. c

This c
holiday c
will c
help c
me c
to c
think c
and i
prepare c
it c
. c

I c
'd c
prefer c
staying i
in c
log i
cabins i
because c
I c
need c
a c
proper c
place c
to c
say i
and c
study c
. i

Basically c
, c
I c
do c
n't c
like c
staying c
in c
a c
small c
tent c
. c

When c
I c
get c
the i
camp c
, c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
swim c
and c
climb c
. c

I c
used c
to c
climb c
mountains c
and c
am c
good c
at c
climbing c
. c

I c
am c
fond c
of c
swimming c
but c
unfortunately c
I c
am c
not c
a c
good c
swimmer c
. c

I c
'd c
like c
to c
ask c
some c
questions c
which i
I c
want c
to c
know c
. c

Is c
there c
any i
toilet c
and c
shower c
in c
the c
log c
cabins c
or c
somewhere c
nearby c
? c

Do c
I c
have c
to c
bring c
any c
special c
clothes c
? c

Do c
you c
have c
any c
idea c
what c
is i
the c
weather c
going c
to c
be c
? i

How c
much c
mone i
do c
you c
recommend c
me c
to c
bring c
with c
me c
? c

Is c
the c
camp c
close c
to c
town i
or c
city c
? c

Will c
you c
provide c
me c
an i
instructor c
when c
I c
climb c
and c
swim c
? c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

I c
haven't c
written c
you i
for c
ages c
. c

I c
do c
apologise c
for c
this c
. c

How c
are c
you c
? c

How c
is c
your c
new c
school c
and c
parents i
? c
I c
hope c
we c
can c
catch c
up c
with c
each c
other c
's c
news c
. c

Last c
month c
I c
helped c
the c
service c
crew c
at c
a c
pop c
concert c
. c

It c
was c
unbelievable c
and i
tiring c
as c
well c
. c

I c
saw c
all c
the c
pop c
bands c
and c
singers c
. c

I c
heard c
them c
talking c
behind i
the c
stage c
. c

They c
signed c
my c
diary c
and c
took i
a c
photo c
with c
me c
. c

Being c
a c
security c
guard c
was c
the c
hardest c
task c
. c

Carrying c
big c
speakers c
place i
to c
place c
was c
extremely c
tiring c
but c
we c
had c
loads c
of c
laugh i
. c

Believe c
it c
or c
not c
I i
put c
make c
up i
on c
one c
famous c
singer c
's c
face c
. c

I c
was c
just c
walking c
down c
by c
dressing i
room c
manager i
said i
that i
if c
I c
could c
help c
them c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
believe c
my c
eyes i
. c

I c
was c
in c
her c
room c
and i
helping c
her c
. c

Especially i
I c
liked c
that c
time c
. c

I c
advise c
you c
to c
do c
something c
like c
that c
. c

I c
'm c
going c
to c
help c
them c
again c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Dear c
Miss c
Ryan c
, c

I c

me c
about c
the c
competition c
I c
've c
won c
. c

I c
've c
never c
been c
to c
the c
U.S.A. c
before c
so c
I c
think c
it c
'll c
be c
an c
exciting c
trip c
. c

With c
regard c
to c
the c
date c
of c
the c
trip c
, c
July c
would c
be c
best c
because c
in c
June c
I c
'm c
going c
to c
visit c
my c
family c
in c
Mexico c
and c
in c
August c
school c
begins c
. c

I c
've c
never c
been c
camping c
before c
, c
I c
guess c
I c
'm c
not c
an c
outdoor c
girl c
, c
but c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
give c
it c
a c
try c
, c
so c
I c
'd c
rather c
tents c
than c
cabins c
. c

I c
'm c
really c
keen c
on c
sports c
, c
especially c
sailing c
. c

I c
've c
practised i
sailing c
since c
an c
early c
age c
and c
I c
perfectly i
manage c
the c
rigging c
and c
sail c
. c

I c
'm c
also c
fond c
of c
tennis c
, c
I c
've c
just c
started c
my c
lessons c
and c
would c
like c
to c
continue c
practising i
during c
the c
summer c
. c

So c
, c
I c
think c
I c
'll c
do c
sailing c
and c
tennis c
. c

I c
'm c
not c
really c
sure c
of i
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
to c
take c
, i
could c
you c
please c
write c
to c
me c
specifying c
what c
would c
be c
suitable c
? c
I c
'd c
appreciate c
it c
a c
lot c
. c

Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c

I c
'm c
a c
shopaholic c
, c
but c
I c
have c
to c
admit c
shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

For c
instance c
, c
I c
spent c
my c
Spring c
Break c
with c
my c
friends c
in c
Italy c
, i
we c
went c
there c
to c
buy c
our c
dresses c
for c
our c
boyfriends c
' c
graduation c
( c
besides c
other c
reasons c
) c
. c

They c
had c
invited c
us c
and c
we c
wanted c
them c
to c
see c
us c
stunningly i
beautiful c
. c

While c
we c
were c
in c
Florence c
my c
wallet c
was c
stolen c
, c
probably c
by c
a c
gypsie i
. c

I c
was c
so c
annoyed c
! c

I c
was c
in c
the c
Plaza c
Espagna c
in c
Florence c
without c
a c
penny c
! c

My c
friends c
lent c
me c
some c
money c
, c
but c
it c
was c
n't c
more c
than c
120 c
pounds c
. c

I c
had c
to c
buy c
my c
dress c
, c
it i
's c
accesories i
and c
besides i
clothes c
and c
souvenirs c
! c

I c
could c
n't c
really c
do c
much c
, c
so c
I c
used c
the c
money c
I c
had c
and c
bought c
an c
incredible c
pair c
of c
shoes c
and c
some c
souvenirs c
. c

I c
felt c
really c
bad c
seeing c
my c
friends c
buy c
the c
latest c
fashion c
while c
the c
only c
thing c
I c
could c
do c
was c
tell c
them c
how c
great c
their c
clothes c
were c
and c
of c
course c
window c

shop c

Dear c

Thank c

very c
much c
for c
your c
last c
lovely c

. c

How c

? c

You c

interessted i
on i

last c
job c
! c
I c
really c
like i
to c
tell c
you c
all c
my i
experience c
. c

However c
, c
I c
'm c
happy c
that c
we c
finished i
this c
hard c
work c
. c
I c
worked c
in c
a c
team c
by i
seven c
people c
. c

We c
were c
mainly c
on i
work i
for i
all c
the c
lights c
at c
this c
great c
concert c
. c

Its i
sounds c
easy c
, c
just c
for i
the c
light i
. c

In c
addition c
, c
it c
was c
a i
nine c
days c
hard i
work c
to c
mount c
all c
the c
different c
spot c
and c
houndreds i
of c
Coblights c
on i
the c
right c
place c
. c

Finally c
, c
we c
had i
worked c
the c
hohl i
night c
befor i
the c
concert c
. c

We c
had c
to c
adjust c
the c
laser c
extremly i
on i
the c
correct c
position c
. c

We c
spent c
hours c
till i
it c
was c
good c
enough c
for c
the c
Technical i
- c
manger c
. c

Moreover c
, c
the c
band c
was c
exhausted c
about i
this c
great c
laser c
show c
at i
the c
end c
. c

For c
me c
was i
this c
aventure c
one c
of c
the c
Best c
. c

It c
shows c
, i
when c
all c
member i
of c
a c
group c
work c
hard c
together c
, c
you c
can c
reach i
a c
lot c
. c

I i
think c
I c
ca c
n't c
forgotten c
this c
experience c
on c
my c
mind c

Lots c
of c
Love c

Leon c

Dear c
Manager c
, c

With c
this c
letter c
I c
want c
to c
show i
you i
some c
problems c
I c
had c
last c
week c
in i
your c
theatre c
with c
your c
show c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
want c
to c
introduce c
myself c
. c

I c
'm c
Francesco c
Schein c
, c
I c
'm c
18 c
years c
old c
and c
I c
went c
last c
week c
to c
see c
your c
musical c
show c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
. c

I c
was c
very c
upset c
because c
the c
show c
had c
many c
problems c
. c

First c
the c
actor c
was c
changed c
and c
his c
performance i
was c
very c
poor c
and c
disappointing c
. c

Then c
, c
the c
show c
began c
45 c
minutes c
later i
, c
so c
we c
had c
to c
wait c
very i
long c
. i

The c
advertisement c
said c
there c
were c
discounts c
available c
, c
which c
were c
not c
. i

At i
the c
end c
you c
said c
it i
will i
be c
a c
Restaurant c
, c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
, c
so c
we c
could c
n't c
eat c
anything c
untill i
we c
got c
home c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
understand c
your c
faults i
and c
I c
'm c
asking c
you c
for c
the i
money c
back c
. c

Faithfully c
Yours c

I c
do c
n't c
know c
if c
technology c
has c
totally c
changed c
my c
life c
, c
because c
I c
was c
born c
with c
it c
and c
I c
have c
learned c
it i
since c
I c
was c
a c
little c
boy c
. c

For c
example c
, c
I c
was c
born c
knowing c
the i
man c
has c
stepped i
on c
the c
moon c
. c

There c
are c
some c
machines c
which c
have c
helped c
in c
my c
development c
, c
and c
others c
which c
help c
me c
to c
make c
my c
life c
easier c
. c

The c
computer c
for c
example c
makes c
communication c
much c
easier c
and c
faster c
then i
in c
past i
time c
, c
when c
everything c
was c
send i
by c
common i
mail c
, c
and c
it c
took i
weeks c
till c
it c
got c
the i
right c
place c
. c

There c
are c
other c
machines c
which c
are c
bad c
for c
the c
environment c
. c

Many c
industries c
throw c
their c
contaminated c
air c
away c
, c
without c
cleaning c
it c
before i
. c

Technology c
has c
to c
move c
further c
so c
it c
can c
solve c
problems c
as i
pollution c
, c
so c
we c
can c
live c
better c
and c
longer c
. c

Dear c
Helen c

I c
am c
very c
surprised c
for i
have i
received c
your c
letter c
in c
which c
you c
explained c
to c
me c
that c
I c
have c
won c
prize i
in c
your c
competition c
. c

After c

, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
say c
Thanks c

I c

As c

in c
your c
letter c
I c
have c
to c
choose c
the c
accommodation i
type c
. c
I c
would c
prefer c

type c
of c
accommodation c

About c

prefer c
to c
do c
basketball c
and c
photography c
. c

I c

photography c
is c
my c
favoorate i

. c

Now c
I c
can c
tell c
you c
that c
it c
was c
an c
amaizing i
challange i
for c
me c
because c
I c
never i
did c
anything c
like c
that c
. c

My c
duties c
like i
a c
organization i

were c
diferent i
, i
the c
firts i
day c
I c
had c
to c
pick c
the c
bands c
up c
at i
the c
airport c
, c
for i
it i
I c
hired c

The c

at i
the c
back i
- c
stage c
supporting c
the c
catering c
staff c

Particularly i
I c

to c
had i
know i
the c
most c
popular c

Dear c
Sir c

Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
you c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
. c

I c
have c
recently c

holiday c
. c

As c

am c
an i
enthusiasmic i
of c
musicals c
I c
went c
to c
see c
this c
musical i
show c
. c

I c
am c
very c
disappointed c
because c
the c
things c
that c
were c
writen i
on i
the c
advertisment i
were c
not c
really c
true c
. c

It c
was c
writen i
that c
the c
stars c
would c
be c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
. c

Danny c
Brook c
is c
one c
of c
my c
favorite i
actors c
and c
there c
was i
playing c
another i
one c
. c

I c
felt c
abosolutly i
disapointed i
. c

The c
musical c
should c
have c
begun c
at c
19:30 c
, c
but c
it c
started c
at c
20:15 c
; c
it i
is c
inacceptable i
! c

It c
was c
writen i
too c
that c
there c
were c
discounts c
available c
and c
I c
asked c
for i
them c
and c
they c
said c
me i
that c
they c
were c
n't c
allow i
to c
do i
any c
discount c
. c

After c
the c
show c
me c
and c
my c
friends c
wanted c
to c
have c
a c
drink c
and c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
because c
there c
were c
n't c
enough c
drinks c
. c

As c
you c
say c
in c
your c
advertisment i
it i
was c
not c
my c
perfect c
evening c
out c
and c
therefore c
I c
would c
like c
to c
have c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

How c
has c
modern c
technology c
changed c
our c
daily c
life i
? c

Modern c
technology c
has c
changed c
a i
lot c
our c
daily c
life c
. c

On c
one i
hand c
nowadays i
if c
we c
have c
to c
travel c
to c
Paris c
and c
return c
in i
the c
same c
day c
you c
can c
take c
a c
plane c
without c
any c
problem c
. c

In c
the c
past c
it c
was c
impossible c
to c
go c
to c
Paris c
from c
Barcelona c
and c
come c
back c
in c
one c
day c
. c

Another c
advantage c
is c
that c
if c
you c
go c
on c
an c
excursion c
and c
you c
take c
your c
mobile c
phone c
, c
if c
you c
get c
lost c
somebody c
could i
find c
you c
. c

I c
think c
that c
the c
most c
important c
modern i
technology c
in i
these c
days c
is c
internet i
. c

With c
internet i
you c
can c
do c
whatever c
you c
want c
without c
going c
out c
home i
( c
shoping i
, c
speaking c
with c
a c
friend c
, c
working c
, c
putting c
your c
money c
aside c
.... c
) c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
the i
main c
disadvantage c
is c
that c
using c
modern c
machines c
it i
can c
be c
very c
difficult c
for c
ederly i
people c
; c
it c
would c
be c
very c
pratitable i
if c
the c
modern c
industries c
train i
people c
about i
using i
modern c
technologies c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
modern i
technology c
has c
change i
a i
lot c
our c
daily c
life c
and c
this c
is c
going c
to c
increase i
. c

Dear c
Mr c

I c
'm c
writting i
to c
you c
to c
thank c
you c
for c

But c
the c
students c
in c
our c

seen c
an c
adverstisement i

same c
time c
we c
have c
to c

Museum c
but c
we c
would c
all c
like c
to c
go c
to c
the c
show c
. c

It c
will c

more c
advantage c
: c

. c

So c
we c
would c
like c
to c
suggest c

how c
the c
programme c
could c
be c
changed c
. c

First c
of c
all c
on c
Tuesday c
we c
all i
will c
go c
to c
the c
show c
and c
spend c
there i
all c

day c
, c
but c

Wednesday c
in c
the c
afternoon c
when c

free i
time c

can c
go c
to c
the c
Science c
Museum c
if i
you c

n't c

of c

. c

Please c

, i
as c

Dear c
Helen c
Ryan c

I c
have c
just c
received c
your c
letter c
, c
and c
thank c
you c
very c
much c
for c
your c
reply c
. c

I c
am c
very c
happy c
to c
take c
part c
in c
the c
competition c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
all c
the c
information c
you c
need c
: c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
am c
available c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
from c
1st c
to c
20th c
because c
my c
university c
will c
be c
closed c
during c
this i
month c
. c

Secondly c
, c
if c
you c
do c
n't c
mind c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
to c
sleep c
in c
a c
tent c
. c

Although c
it c
is c
not c
very c
comfortable c
, c
I c
like c
camping c
very c
much c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
I c
am c
very c
interested c
in c
swimming c
and c
also c
climbing c
. c

I c
took c
up c
climbing c
five c
years c
ago c
and c
I c
am c
very c
keen c
on c
. i

I c
am c
very c
good c
at c
swimming c
as c
well c
because c
I c
practise c
this c
sport c
every c
week c
in c
my c
city c
. c

Finally c
, c
could c
you c
tell c
me c
what c
I c
need c
to c
dress i
and c
also c
how c
much c
money c
I c
will c
spend c
on i
. i

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

I c
have c
asked i
to c
write c
a c
composition c
regarding c
the c
questionit i
is c
believed c
that c
shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

In c
fact c
, c
to i
do c
shopping c
can c
be i
some c
disavantages i
for c
different c
reasons c
: c

Firstly c
, c
you c
have c
to c
queue c
for c
a c
long c
time c
to c
get c
a c
free c
cabin i
and c
waste c
of i
time c
putting c
on c
some c
clothes c
and i
in c
the c
end c
they c
are c
not c
the c
right c
size c
. c

Secondly c
, c
it c
is c
easy c
to c
spend c
a c
lot c
of c
money c
in c
few i
minutes c
and c
as i
soon c
as c
you c
can c
regret c
to i
buy c
all c
these i
clothes c
, i
which c
you c
do c
n't c
really c
need c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
some c
clothes c
can c
have c
some c
stains c
on c
and c
you c
haven't c
noticed c
this c
before c
buying c
, i
so c
you c
have c
to c
go c
back c
to c
the c
shop c
. c

However c
, c
it c
is c
not c
easy c
to c
get c
a c
refund c
or c
to c
change c
them c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
doing i
shopping c
bring i
me c
a c
lot c
of c
satisfaction c
especially c
I i
am c
depressed c
, i
nevertheless c
it c
could c
be c
very c
dangerous c
for c
my c
wallet c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
service c
you i
'd c
offered c
me c
last c
Saturday c
evening c
at c
The c
Circle c
Theatre c
. c

I c
've i
read c
your c
advertisement c
and c
it c
did c
n't c
say i
the c
truth c
. c

There c
were c
n't c
any c
discount i
available c
as c
you c
'd c
assured c
in i
the c
add i
. c

I c
think c
you c
should c
check c
the c
information c
before c
print i
it c
! c

I c
arrived c
at c
the c
right c
time c
( c
19.30 c
) c
that c
evening c
but c
the c
play c
, c
which c
was c
' c
Over c
The c
Rainbow c
' c
, c
started c
almost c
an c
hour c
later i
. c

And c
nobody c
told c
me c
why c
! c

When c
the c
play c
began c
I c
realised c
that c
the c
main c
actor c
had c
been c
changed i
and c
the c
new c
one c
was c
n't c
good c
at c
all c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
visit c
the c
theatre c
after c
the c
performance c
because c
it c
was c
closed c
for c
reparations i
. c

Why c
did c
n't c
you c
say c
something c
about c
it c
? c

I c
did c
n't c
have c
the c
' c
perfect c
evening c
out c
' c
you c
'd c
promised c
so c
I c
want c
to c
ask c
for c
my c
money c
back c
because c
your c
service c
was c
terrible c
. c

Please c
answer c
my c
letter c
as c
soon c
as c
possible c
. c

I c
'll c
be c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c

How c
Has c
Modern c
Technology c
Changed c
My c
Daily c
Life c
? c
' c

This c
is c
not c
a c
simple c
question c
because c
I c
got i
used c
to c
dealing c
with c
technology c
since c
I c
was c
a c
child c
but c
I c
'm c
going c
to c
try c
to c
explain c
you i
how c
. i

I c
did c
n't c
have c
a c
computer c
until c
I c
was c
eight c
. c

Then c
my c
brother c
and c
I c
started c
to c
develop c
a c
new c
ability c
. c

In i
that c
time c
I c
used c
the c
computer c
only c
to c
play c
with i
its c
video c
games c
. c

When c
I c
was c
thirteen c
I c
discovered c
a c
completely c
different c
use c
for c
my c
computer c
. c

It c
became c
scencial i
to c
do i
my c
homework c
. c

And c
years c
later c
it c
enabled c
me c
to c
get c
a c
very c
good c
job c
. c

One c
day c
my c
mother c
got c
a c
terrible c
disease c
. c

She c
had c
to c
be c
operated c
on c
and c
my c
family c
and c
I c
were c
very c
scared c
. c

But c
when c
we c
talked c
to c
the c
doctor c
we c
felt c
more c
relaxed c
because c
he c
answered i
us c
that c
the c
operation c
was c
a c
very c
simple c
one c
. c

I c
think c
that c
if c
my c
mother c
had c
got c
ill c
ten c
years c
before c
, c
she c
would c
n't c
survive i
. c

The i
modern c
technology c
is c
better c
now c
than c
what i
it c
used c
to c
be c
. c

What c
do c
you c
think c
about c
this c
? c

I c
'm c
sure c
that c
these c
arguments c
have c
explained c
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
haven't c
they c
? c

Now c
I c
would c
like c
to c
have c
your c
point c
of c
view c
. c

Dear c
Mrs. c
Ryan c

I c
'm c
writing c
you i
in c
response c
to c
your c
letter c

I c
was c
delighted c
to c
know c
that c
I c
won c
the c
first c
price i
. c

With c

stay c
in c
is c
a c
log c
cabin c
, c
where c
I c
'm c
sure c
I c
'd c
feel c
more c
confortable i
than c
in c
a c
tent c
. c

It c
's c
very c
nice c
of c
you c
to c
let c
me c
choose c
my c
favourite c
activities c
. c

The c
ones c
I c
'm c
most c
keen c
on c
are c
Tennis i
, c
in i
which c
I c
think c
I c
'm c
pretty c
good c
since c
I c
took c
some c
classes c
last c
year c
, c
and c
Painting i
, c
which c
is c
one c
of c
my c
favourite c
hobbies c
, c
and c
helps c
me c
to c
relax c
myself i
and c
forget c
about c
problems c
. c

I c
think c
I c
'm c
not c
bad c
at c
painting c
either c
, i
at c
least c
everyone c
in c
my c
family c
likes c
my c
work c
, c
includying i
myself c
. c

Anyway c
, c
there c
are c
some c
questions c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
ask c
you c
: c
What i
kind c
of c
clothes c
would c
be c
the c
most c
suitable c
for c
California c
weather c
in c
summer c
, c
and c
how c
much c
money c
do c
you c
think c
I c
'll c
need c
? c

I c
'm c
waiting i
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

I c
'm c
so c
sorry c
I c
haven't c
written c
until c
now c
, c
but c
you c
know c
I c
'm c
always c
very c
busy c
. c

As c
I c
told c
you c
in c
my c
last c
letter c
, c
last c
month c
I c
worked c
for c
a c
pop c
band c
, c
and c
helped c
them c
at c
a c
concert c
in c
Barcelona c
. c

It c
was c
such c
a c
great c
experience c
! c

Basically c
my c
work c
was c
carrying c
the c
instruments c
, c
the c
speakers c
and c
the c
lights c
from c
the c
vans c
to c
the c
stage c
, c
which c
is c
not c
an i
easy c
work c
because c
, c
as c
you c
can c
imagine c
, c
it c
's c
not c
exactly c
light c
stuff c
. c

But c
the c
most c
exciting c
part c
was c
meeting c
the c
band c
, c
mainly c
the c
singer c
and c
the c
drummer c
who c
are c
very c
nice c
and c
also c
good c
- c
looking c
. c

Anyway c
, c
I c
had c
lot i
of c
fun c
working c
for c
them c
. c

I c
hope c
they c
call c
me c
soon c
, i
I c
'd c
be c
the c
happiest c
girl c
in c
the c
world c
if c
I c
could c
see c
them c
again c
... c

I c
'd c
better c
leave i
now c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
write c
again c
soon c
. c

Dear c
Madam c

I c
am c
very c
happy c
to c
win c
this c
prize c
and c
I c
am c
going c
to c
give c
you c
some c
information c
from i
me c
that c
you c
need c
to c
make i
me i
have c
a c
good c
time c
at c
Camp c
California c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
know i
only c
in c
July c
because c
I c
have c
set i
my c
holidays c
this i
month c
since c
last c
January c
. c

I i
want c
if c
it c
is c
possible c
a c
log c
cabins i
like i
accommodation c
because c
I c
have c
been c
suffering c
from i
my c
back c
since c
my c
childhood c
, c
therefore c
I c
need c
a c
confortable i
accommodation i
. c

I c
will c
be c
pleased c
to c
swim c
and c
paint c
when c
I c
am c
at c
the c
camp c
. c

I c
selected c
swimming c
because c
it c
is c
a c
cure c
against i
my c
backace i
and c
I c
have c
not c
practiced i
since i
I c
started c
my c
new c
job c
five c
years c
ago c
. c

I c
also c
choosed i
painting c
because c
I c
have c
never c
done c
before i
, i
I c
would c
like c
to c
learn c
and c
moreover c
I c
want c
to c
do c
a c
calm i
activity c
. c

Otherwise i
, c
could c
you c
tell c
me c
approximately c
how c
much c
money c
I c
have c
to c
take c
for c
the i
food c
, c
please c
? c

Yours c
sincerely i

Fournier c

How c
many c
times c
have c
we c
heard c
people c
complaining c
about c
shopping c
? c

Sometimes c
, c
they c
are c
happy c
to c
do i
shopping c
. i

but c
why c
? c

Therefore i
, c
shopping c
can c
be c
enjoyable c
but c
it i
is c
not c
always c
the c
case c
. c

Shopping c
is c
enjoyable c
when c
you c
want c
to c
offer i
some i
thing c
to c
someone c
. c

In i
fact c
you c
try c
to c
get c
a c
present c
to c
make c
receive i
happy c
. c

Shopping c
is c
also c
good c
, i
when c
you c
know c
what c
you c
want c
. c

For c
example c
if c
you c
want c
a c
new c
track c
suit c
you c
know c
that c
you c
have c
to c
go c
to c
a c
sport i
shop c
but c
if c
you c
do c
n't c
know c
what c
you c
want c
you c
are c
going c
to c
waste c
your c
time c
in c
the c
shops c
. c

In i
the c
opposite c
, c
shopping c
can c
be c
disenjoyable i
. c

Shopping c
is c
boring c
if c
you c
go c
with c
people c
too i
fussy c
. c

That c
is c
to c
say c
, c
they c
are c
never c
happy c
with c
what c
they c
get c
and i
see c
. c
They c
always c
find c
a c
problem c
. c

Shopping c
is c
not c
enjoyable c
with c
people c
who c
just c
look c
around c
the c
shops c
. c

It c
is c
stupid c
, i
they c
do c
not c
have c
any c
goal c
. c

They c
waste c
their c
time c
. c

To c
conclude c
, c
I c
agree c
with i
shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

Even c
if c
I c
like c
to c
do i
shopping c
with c
some c
people c
and c
kind i
of c
shops c
I c
will c
kill c
myself c
because i
I c
waste c
my c
time c
. c

To c
the c
manager c
of c
the c

Circle c
Theatre c
in c
London c

I c
'm c
a c
tourist c
and c
I c
had c
a c
week c
's c
holiday c
in c
London c
a i
few c
time c
ago c
. c

I c
had c
enjoied i
to c
see c
the c
musical c
show c
that c
the c
Circle c
Theatre c
presented c
some c
night i
ago c
; c
and c
the c
actor c
's i
Danny c
Brook c
performance i
. c

I c
went c
to c
the c
theatre c
at c
19.30 c
o'clock i
but c
, c
with i
my c
surprise c
, c
the c
show c
started c
at c
20:15 c
and c
so c
I c
could c
n't c
remain c
here i
until c
the c
end c
because c
I c
left i
London c
, c
with c
my c
group c
before c
the c
end c
of c
the c
show c
. c

The c
star c
, c
the c
actor c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
there i
was c
n't c
in c
the c
musical c
show c
but c
there c
was c
an i
other c
actor c
, c
with i
my c
great c
disappoint c
. c

Then c
, c
in c
the c
program i
I c
could c
read c
a i
discount c
available c
for i
the c
tickets c
, c
for c
the i
groups c
, c
but c
I c
could c
n't c
have i
that c
. c
I c
could c
n't c
have c
all c
the c
things c
I c
expected c
. c

That c
evening c
was c
terrible c
for c
me c
and c
for c
my c
friends c
, c
so c
I c
'm c
not c
satisfied c
about i
your c
informations i
and c
I c
ask c
some i
money c
back c
. c

I c
hope c
in i
your c
answer c
and c
in c
your c
explanation c
about c
this c
. c

Your i
Sincerely c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Some c
days c
ago c
, c
when c
the i
school c
was c
ending i
, c
Pat c
and c
her c
friends c
decided c
to c
make i
a c
party c
for c
their c
friend c
, c
Frances c
, c
because c
the c
end c
of c
the c
school c
and i
the i
Francis c
's c
birthday c
were c
the i
same c
day c
. c

That c
might i
be i
a c
secret c
for c
Francis c
- c
and c
they c
decided c
the i
program i
and c
the c
present c
, c
a c
new c
gold c
watch c
. c

Peter c
and c
Sue c
asked c
to i
Francis c
some i
help c
for i
their c
exam c
's i
subjets i
and c
Francis c
, c
for i
to c
help c
them c
, c
was c
very c
busy c
all c
the c
week c
. c

The c
last c
day c
all c
the c
friends c
went c
to c
Pat c
's c
home c
with c
food c
, c
musical c
instruments c
, c
tape i
recorder c
. c

Pat c
was c
very c
excited c
about c
this c
. c

In c
the c
afternoon c
she c
had c
phoned c
at i
a i
Francis c
's c
mother c
and c
she c
explained i
her c
the c
secret c
, c
then c
she c
phoned c
at i
her c
best c
friend c
and c
she c
speak i
about c
that c
too i
; c
she c
phoned c
at i
many c
people c
all c
the i
day c
. c

Now c
many i
people c
knew c
the c
secret c
but c
Pat c
said i
everyone c
: c
" c
I c
tell i
you c
a c
small c
secret c
, c
but c
you i
do c
n't c
speak c
, i
please c
! c
" c

In c
the c
night c
Francis c
was c
invited c
to c
the c
party c
, c
at c
Pat c
's c
home c
. c

When c
he c
was c
out c
he c
needed c
to c
buy c
some c
cigarettes c
so c
he c
went c
to c
the c
shop c
where c
the c
owner c
, c
a i
his c
friend c
, c
ask i
him c
if c
he c
was c
very c
happy c
about c
his c
present c
, c
the c
new c
gold c
watch c
, c
he c
was c
very c
lucky c
to c
have c
best c
friends c
like c
Pat c
and c
her c
friends c
. c

The i
Francis c
's c
secret c
was c
discovered c
! c

Now c
all i
the c
Pat c
's c
friend c
do c
n't c
tell c
her c
about c
their c
secrets c
because c
Pat c
is c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
, c

I c
went c
to c
your c
show c
called c
" c
Over c
The c
Rainbow c
" c
and c
I c
was c
really c
disappointing i
in i
many c
points i
. c

Firstly c
, c
you c
spoke c
about c
two c
actors c
Danny i
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
, c
instead i
of c
them c
we c
had c
two c
others c
and c
they c
were c
really c
bad c
. c

So c
I c
was c
really c
surprised c
. c

In c
addition c
to c
this c
you c
started c
the c
show c
45 c
minutes c
late c
. c

It c
was c
boring c
for c
everybody c
. c

How c
could c
we c
appreciate c
the c
show c
properly c
. c

Moreover c
, c
in c
your c
advert c
you c
spoke i
about i
discounts c
available c
but c
it c
was c
not c
the c
case c
. c

No c
discounts c
were c
available c
. c

Then c
you c
offered i
people c
to c
visit c
your c
theatre c
restaurant c
after c
the c
show c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
because c
there c
is i
no c
staff c
to c
welcome c
the i
people c
. c

You c
offered c
something c
impossible i
to c
do c
. c

I c
did c
not c
have c
a c
good c
time c
for c
all c
of c
this i
reasons c
and c
I c
would c
like c
you c
to c
give c
my i
money c
back c
. c

I c
hope c
your i
understand c
my c
request c
and c
you c
are c
going c
to c
reply c
as c
soon c
as c
possible c
. c

Thank c
you c
. c

yours c
sincerely c

O. c
Labro c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

The c
nightmare c
started c
at i
this c
time c
. c

I c
though i
she c
was c
a c
really c
good c
friend c
but c
I c
made c
a c
mistake c
. c

She c
could c
n't c
keep c
my c
secret c
and c
everybody c
knew c
which c
boy c
I c
was c
in c
love c
with c
. c

She c
did c
n't c
tell c
me c
yet i
but c
when c
I c
came c
in i
class i
everybody c
was c
looking c
at c
me c
and c
this c
boy c
as c
well c
. c

I c
looked c
at c
her c
and c
she c
became c
pale c
and c
suddently i
left c
the c
class c
. c

I c
followed c
her c
and c
caught c
her c
to c
push c
her c
on i
the c
ground c
. c

I c
was c
ready c
to c
fight c
but c
somebody c
stopped c
me c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
go c
back c
to c
the c
class c
so c
I c
went c
home c
. c

My c
Mum c
was c
at c
home c
and c
I c
told c
her c
all i
the c
story c
. c

She c
said c
that c
I c
had c
to c
be c
strong c
and c
did i
n't c
care c
about c
them c
. c

So c
I c
went c
to c
the c
class c
and c
everybody c
was c
laughing c
at c
me c
and c
the c
boy c
told c
them c
to c
stopped i
because c
he c
loved c
me c
and c
wanted c
to c
be c
with c
me c
. c

At i
this c
time c
all c
the c
girls c
became c
jealous c
and c
stopped c
to i
laugh c
. c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
. i

It c
is c
a c
pleasure c
to c
write c
to c
you c
and c
we c
want c
to c
thanks i
for i
organising c
a c
school c
trip c
to c
London c
. c

We c
have c
seen c
the c
programme c
list i
and c
we c
all c
think c
it c
will c
be c
enjoyable c
. c

Especially i
to c
the c
science c
museum c
because c
we c
all i
doing c
science c
in c
school c
. c

Recently c
, c
some c
students c
have c
seen c
an c
advertisment i
about c
a c
fashion c
and c
leisure c
show c
in c
London c
. c
it i
will c
be c
on c
the c
14th c
and c
we c
all c
want c
to c
go c
. c

So c
, c
it c
would c
be c
greatful i
if c
you c
can i
give c
us c
this c
opportunity c
to c
watch c
the c
show c
. c

This c
is c
a c
great c
opportunity c
to c
learn c
something c
else i
because c
most c
of c
us c
have c
not c
been c
to c
this c
kind c
of c
show c
And i
it c
is c
free c
for c
students c
. c
it i
will c
be c
incredible c
if c
we c
have c
a c
chance c
to c
watch c
the c
show c
. c

So c
could c
you c
give c
us c
permission c
to c
go c
? c

We c
also i
can c
suggest c
how c
the c
originally i
programme c
can c
be c
changed c
. c

We c
will c
have c
free c
time c
on c
Wednesday c
afternoon c
. c

So c
we c
can c
do i
shopping c
instead c
. c

Then c
, c
we c
can c
go c
to c
the c
show c
during c
that c
period c

We c
are c
all c
looking c
forward c
for i
you i
answer c
. c

faithful i

It c
was c
dangerous c
, c
but c
I c
knew c
I c
had c
to c
do c
it c
. c

Because c
there c
was c
a c
man c
had i
a i
serious c
car c
accident c
and c
I c
was c
walking c
pass i
him c
. c

Nobody c
had c
noticed c
him c
because c
it c
happened c
at c
night c
and c
the c
car c
had c
actually c
crashed c
into c
the c
bushes c
. c

I c
was c
thinking c
' c
what c
should c
I c
do c
? c
' c
I c
haven't i
got c
my c
mobile c
phone c
with c
me c
And i
I c
was c
half i
way c
between c
my c
school c
and c
home c
. c

At c
that c
time c
he c
was c
unconcious i
, i
I c
kept c
asking c
myself c
' c
should i
I c
wake c
him c
up c
or c
try c
to c
use c
my c
unsure i
first c
aid c
skill i
to c
deal i
with c
him c
. c

I c
was c
struggling c
because c
I c
knew c
if c
I c
did c
n't c
help c
him c
, c
he c
would c
die c
in c
a c
short c
time c
. c

I c
decided c
to c
do c
something c
to i
this c
man c
, i
my c
first c
move c
was c
to c
check c
was i
there c
any c
solid c
or c
liquid c
which c
could c
blocked i
his c
breathe i
. c

And c
checking i
his c
body i
condition c
. c

After c
that c
I c
turned c
on c
the c
car c
light i
in c
order c
to c
tell i
the c
passing c
cars c
. c

I c
ran c
back c
home c
for c
help c
. c

I c
phoned c
to i
police i
And i
told c
the i
whole c
story c
. c

The i
strange c
thing c
happened c
to c
me c
, c
when c
I c
got c
back c
to c
that c
man c
. c

The c
car c
and c
the c
man c
were c
not c
there c
anymore c
. c

Where c
could c
they c
be c
? c

I c
was c
wondering c
. c

Oh c
, c
sorry c
they c
were c
not c
in i
this c
road c
, i
they c
were c
in i
the c
next i
road c
. c

Dear c
Madam c
: c

I c
just c
receive i
your c
letter c
with c
the c
good c
news c
. c

I c
am c
very c
happy c
for i
winning c
the c
first c
prize c
in c
your c
competition c
and c
I c
am c
glad c
to c
tell c
you c
that c
I c
am c
planning c
to c
go c
but i
I c
can c
only c
travel c
on i
July c
because c
I c
have c
to c
work c
until c
the c
end c
of c
June c
. c

For i
the c
accommodation c
I i
would c
like c
to c
have c
log i
cabins i
rather c
than c
tents i
because c
two c
weeks c
is c
quite c
a c
long c
time c
and c
I c
think c
they c
are c
more c
comfortable c
and c
give c
you c
more c
privacy c
. c

I c
enjoy c
swimming c
and c
singing c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
join c
others c
in c
these c
activities c
. c

I c
am c
an c
average c
swimmer c
and c
as c
a c
singer c
I c
am c
not c
a c
start i
but i
it c
would c
be c
fun c
to c
share c
my c
songs c
with c
the c
holiday c
makers c
. c

Can c
you c
please c
give c
me c
some c
recomendations i
about c
the c
clothes c
I c
will c
need c
and c
also c
the c
cost c
of c
the c
food c
there c
to c
make i
my c
budget c
. c

Thank c
you c
for c
these c
wonderful c
two c
weeks c
at c
Camp c
California c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c

Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c

In c
my c
opinion c
shopping c
sometimes i
is c
really c
boring c
specially i
when c
you c
buy c
at i
the c
supermarkets c
almost c
all c
the c
time c
the c
same c
things c
like i
cleaning c
products c
and c
the c
ingredients c
for c
every i
day c
food i
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
everything c
looks c
different c
if c
I c
have c
to c
make i
a c
present c
for c
someone c
in c
my c
family c
. c

I c
start c
thinking c
what i
she c
or c
he c
prefer i
and c
I c
try c
my c
best c
buying i
something c
apropiate i
does i
n't c
matter c
how c
much c
money c
does i
it c
cost i
. c

In c
conclusion c
most c
of c
the c
time c
that c
you c
spend c
shopping c
you c
put c
a c
lot c
of c
effort c
choosing i
things c
and c
making c
decissions i
and c
they c
are c
more c
or c
less c
important c
, c
or c
more c
or c
less c
enjoyable c
depends i
on c
what c
, c
why c
, c
where c
and c
who c
is c
the c
person c
that c
you c
are c
interested c
to i
please c

10 i
MINUTES c
AFTER c

RIGHT c

NOTHING c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
order c
to c
explain c
to c
you c
the c
problems c
regarding c
the c
musical c
show c
I c
saw c
at c
your c
theatre c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
there i
was c
written c
in c
the c
advertisement c
for c
the c
show c
, i
that c
there i
would i
be c
Danny c
Brook c
as c
main c
actor c
, c
but c
a c
different c
actor c
played c
in c
the c
show c
. c

The c
show c
started c
forty c
- c
five c
minutes c
later i
and c
this c
really c
disappointed c
me c
. c

Besides c
, c
when c
I c
bought c
the c
ticket c
, c
I c
found c
out c
there c
was i
not c
discounts i
for c
ticket i
, c
while c
you c
wrote c
the c
contrary c
. c

Moreover c
, c
I c
could c
not c
go c
to c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
because c
, c
by c
the c
time c
the c
show c
had c
finished c
, c
it c
had c
already c
closed c
. c

Definetely i
, c
it c
was c
a c
very c
disappointing c
evening c
and c
I c
would c
appreciate c
your i
if c
it c
was i
possible c
to c
have c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
in c
the c
near c
future c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

She c
was c
a c
very c
pretty c
and c
kind c
girl c
, c
but c
she c
had c
this c
bad c
habit c
. c

This c
was c
her c
only c
fault c
. c

She c
had c
a c
lot c
of c
friends c
but c
nobody c
trusted c
her c
. c

That c
was c
why c
she c
decide i
to c
change c
her c
behaviour c
. c

She c
was c
given c
a c
chance c
: c
if c
she c
had i
been c
able c
not c
to c
tell c
everybody c
a c
secret c
for c
a c
short c
time c
, c
her c
friends c
would c
have i
started c
trusting c
her c
. c

The c
secret c
was c
about c
a c
surprise c
- i
party c
for c
her c
bestfriend i
's c
birthday c
. c

As c
soon c
as c
the c
arrangement i
for c
the c
party c
started c
, c
she c
began c
to c
feel c
nervous c
and c
anxious c
because c
she c
wanted c
to c
tell c
everything c
to c
her c
bestfriend i
. c

But c
, c
as c
the c
days c
went c
by c
, c
she c
was c
surprised c
because c
she c
realized c
she c
was c
getting c
used c
not i
to i
tell c
secrets c
any i
more c
. c

The c
day c
of c
the c
party c
arrived c
and c
Pat c
succeeded c
in c
keeping c
the c
secret c
. c

All c
her c
friends c
were c
amazed c
at c

Dear c
Sir c
! c

I c
am c
writing c
this c
letter c
to c
you c
, c
because c
the c
show c
" c
Over c
The c
Rainbow c
" c
which i
is c
the i
London c
's c
newest c
and c
best c
musical c
show c
, c
was c
not c
... c
for c
me c
. c

Pleas i
apologise i
me c
, c
but c
there c
were c
many c
mistakes c
and c
problems c
on c
the c
note i
you c
have c
made c
, c
which c
disappointed c
me c
very c
. i

I c
thought c
that c
Dany c
Brook c
who i
is c
my c
favorite i
actor c
play i
in c
that c
show c
. c

And c
I c
was c
really c
disappointed c
when c
I c
saw c
Jeremy c
Brook c
on c
the c
stage c
. c

Please c
, c
if c
you c
would c
be c
so c
kind c
and i
mind c
correct c
this c
mistake c
. c
I c
would c
be c
gratefull i
if c
you c
could c
correct c
too c
that c
show c
start i
at c
20.15 c
not c
on c
19.30 c
. c

Other i
thing c
was c
that c
there c
was i
no c
discounts c
available c
, c
and c
that c
the c
restaurant c
which i
I c
wanted c
to c
visit c
after c
the c
show c
was i
closed c
because c
of c
the c
main c
cooker i
sikness i
. c

I c
would c
be c
very c
grateful c
if c
I c
could c
get c
my c
money c
back c
. c

That c
evening c
which i
should c
be i
my c
perfect c
evening c
out c
, c
was c
in c
fact c
very c
tireing i
and c
boring c
. c

Apologise i

. c

am c
looking c
forward c
for i
answer i

Best c
regardes i

secrets c
, i
I c
knew c
that c
he c
's c
very i
talkative c
person c

Everything c

She c

touched c

. c

Enyway i
the c
disco c
was c
great c
, c
music i
also c
. c

We c
had c
fun c
to i
5 c
o'clock c
! c

Agatha c
said c
that c
it c
was c
the c
greatest c
present c
she c
could c
ever c
get i
! c

Dear c
Mr i
/ c
Mrs c
, c

I c
've i
seen c
your c
festival c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
you c
my c
suggestions c
to i
it c
. c

I c
must c
say c
that c
International i
Arts c
Festival c
is c
really c
great i
idea c
. c

And c
your c
last c
festival c
was c
very c
intresting i
too c
. c

But c
also c
there c
are c
some c
notes i
that c
you c
should c
improve c
in c
the i
next c
year c
's c
festival c
to c
make c
it c
absolutelly i
wonderful c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
you c
must c
invite c
artists c
and c
stars c
from c
more c
countries c
around c
the c
world c
, c
because c
there c
are i
people c
only c
from c
six c
countries c
. c

I c
think c
it c
can c
make c
your c
festival c
more c
popular c
. c

Jazz c
, c
rock c
and c
classical c
concerts c
are c
amazing c
, c
but c
I c
think c
that c
some c
concert c
halls c
are c
too c
small c
, c
so c
not c
everybody c
can c
come c
. c

Your c
dance c
shows c
are c
very c
beautiful c
, c
art i
exhibitions i
is c
something c
original c
and c
exciting c
. c

And c
also c
it c
is c
very c
interesting c
to c
talk c
with c
writers c
. c

I c
think c
that c
one c
reasonably c
- c
priced c
weekend c
for i
all c
events c
is c
exellent i
idea c
because c
it c
is c
n't c
so c
Expensive i
as c
buying c
ticket i
to i
each c
event c
, c
and c
with c
this c
ticket c
you c
can c
visit c
everything c
you c
want c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
will c
continue c
to i
making i
your c
festivals c
. c

Your i
faithfully c
, c

Dear c
Tom c
, c

How c
are c
you c
? c

Thank c
you c
for c
your c
last c
letter c
. c

It c
was c
very c
interesting c
. c

The c
question c
you c
asked c
me c
in c
it c
is c
very c
original c
too c
. c

I c
must c
say c
that c
rules i
are c
n't c
same i
in c
schools i
of c
our c
country c
. c

Every c
school c
has c
it i
's c
own c
rules c
. c

I c
think c
that c
my c
school c
is c
very c
democratic c
and c
so c
there c
are c
very c
good c
relations c
between c
teachers c
and c
students c
. c

We c
are c
all c
very c
friendly c
in c
our c
class c
and c
we c
help c
to i
each c
other c
when c
we c
have c
a c
problem c
. c

So c
the c
main c
rule c
in c
our c
school c
is c
regarding i
theachers i
. c

I c
'm c
allowed c
to c
do c
many c
things c
at c
home c
. c

My c
parents c
are c
very c
kind c
, c
and c
they c
know c
that c
their c
son c
will c
do c
everything c
right c
. c

And c
the c
main c
reason c
Why i
our c
family c
is c
so c
friendly c
, i
it i
's c
because c
we c
haven't c
go i
many c
rules c
. c

So c
, c
I c
think c
there c
is c
n't c
something i
I c
'd c
like c
to c
change c
. c

I c
hope c
everything c
is c
good c
in c
your c
family c
and c
your c
school c
. c

Take c
care c

Dear c
Mrs c
Ryan c

Regarding c
your c
letter c
dated c
on i
the c
6th c
of c
June c
I c
'm c
so c
happy c
to c
receive c
the c
first c
price i
. c

Thanks c
very c
much c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
to c
California c
. c

The c
reason c
is c
that c
we c
have c
long c
holidays c
at c
school c
on i
this i
time c
. c

Although c
, i
the c
accommodation c
is c
n't c
so c
important c
for c
me c
. i
I c
would c
prefer c
the c
log c
cabin c
because c
of c
the c
comfort c
and c
the c
better c
bed c
. c

I c
have c
choosen i
the i
activities c
surfing c
and c
photography c
. c

I c
'm c
a c
beginner c
on i
both c
activities c
. c

I c
have c
some i
questions c
as c
follow c
: c

1 c
. c
What c
kind c
of c
clothes c
are c
needed c
? c

2 c
. c
What c
I i
have c
to c
pay c
by i
myself c
? c

3 c
. c

Should c
I c
take c
some c
money c
with c
me c
? c

4 c
. c

How c
is c
the c
wheather i
in c
California c
? c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerelly i

Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c

Most c
of c
the c
time c
is i
shopping c
fun c
and c
enjoyable c
. c

There c
are c
a c
lot c
of c
reasons c
that i
could i
be c
awful c
to c
go c
shopping c
. c

Even i
if c
you c
run c
out c
of c
money c
or c
you c
have c
to c
buy c
a c
particular c
thing c
which c
is c
difficult c
to c
find c
. c

I c
had i
once c
this c
problem c
. c

I c
was c
looking c
for c
a c
special c
fruit c
. c

The c
sales c
assistants c
in c
the c
stores c
are c
n't c
so c
nice c
and i
helpful c
. c

Sometimes c
they c
give c
me c
a c
bad c
feeling c
as i
, i
, c
customer c
treat c
with c
order c
" c
. c

Last c
week c
I c
was c
shopping c
with c
my c
younger c
brother c
. c
Awful c
. i

He c
wanted c
everything c
what i
his c
eyes c
saw c
. c

All c
the c
stuff c
for c
children c
are i
in i
the c
same c
level c
as c
they i
have c
their c
eyes c
. c

Afterwards c
, c
I c
felt c
tired c
and c
unsatisfy i
the i
store c
. c

The c
shops c
have c
bad c
opening c
times c
. c

When c
I c
feel c
me i
comfortable c
for c
shopping c
everything c
will i
be c
closed c
or c
you i
haven't c
enough c
time c
to c
look c
around c
. c

My c
conclusion c
on c
these c
points c
are i
not c
so c
bad c
. c
I c
like c
shopping c
at i
all c
with c
my c
best c
friend c
. c

K. c

Shoping i
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

Ten c
or c
fifteen c
years c
ago c
we c
had c
in i
Poland c
empty c
shelves c
in c
shops c
. c

We c
could c
only c
buy c
things c
from c
Russia c
. c

People c
alwas i
queued c
for c
stuff c
from c
west i
. c

If c
you c
had c
wanted c
something c
special c
for c
example c
for c
a c
gift c
you c
had c
to c
stay c
in c
a c
line c
all c
night c
. c

It c
was c
the c
worst c
side c
of c
shopping c
in c
Poland c
couple i
years i
ago c
. c

Nowadays c
we c
have c
capitalism c
, c
free c
market c
lots i
of c
privete i
shops c
, c
markets c
and c
super i
- c
markets c
. c

We c
can c
buy c
everything c
what i
about c
we c
imagine c
. c

Polish c
super i
market c
are c
not c
Polish c
origin i
shops c
. c

They c
are c
imported c
from c
enother i
Western c
Europe i
country c
. c

I c
apprieciate i
this i
shops c
for c
lots c
of c
products c
, c
cheep i
prices c
end i
big c
spaces c
. c

But c
the c
problem c
is c
when c
I c
want c
to c
buy c
only c
one c
thing c
, c
for c
example c
bread c
. c

On c
Friedy i
evening c
and c
at i
on c
the c
weekdays c
each i
supermarkets c
are c
crowded c
. c

They c
are c
filled c
by i
people c
who c
went i
buy i
everything c
. c

I c
do c
not c
like c
crowded c
places c
. c

This c
is c
the c
reason c
why c
I c
do c
not c
like c
shopping c
. c

Dear c
Mrs c
Ryan c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
reply c
to c
your c
letter c
in c
which c
you c
communicate i
I i
have c
won c
first c
prize c
in c
your c
competion i
. c

I c
am c
glad c
. c

Thank c
you c
very c
much c
. c

Now c
I c
am c
answering c
your c
questions c
and c
then c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
further i
information c
about c
travel c
and c
accomodation i
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
because c
in c
June c
I c
am c
going c
to c
take c
some c
exams c
at c
University i
and c
at c
the c
moment c
I c
do c
not c
know c
the c
exact c
date c
. c

I c
can c
tell c
you c
I c
am c
only c
free c
in c
July c
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
an i
accomodation c
in c
log i
cabins i
because c
I c
am c
not c
keen c
on c
tents c
and c
I c
think c
that c
a c
log c
cabin c
is c
more c
comfortable c
than c
a c
tent c
. c

As c
regard i
as c
the c
chance c
to c
do c
two c
activities c
while c
I c
am c
at c
the c
Camp c
I c
would c
like c
to c
practise i
painting c
and c
photography c
. c

I c
am i
a c
painter c
in c
oils c
from c
life c
and c
my c
subjects c
are c
landscapes c
, c
people c
, c
animals c
. c

I c
like i
also c
taking c
photographs c
, c
for c
example c
during c
my c
journeys c
or c
trips c
. c

So c
when c
I c
go c
back c
home c
I c
can c
use c
my c
best c
pictures c
to c
reproduce c
them c
as c
a c
painting c
. c

Would c
you c
give c
me c
some c
information c
about c
clothes i
to c
wear c
there c
? c

I c
would c
like i
also c
to c
know c
how c
much c
money c
I c
can c
bring c
. c

Looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Billy c
Esposito c

There c
is c
somebody c
who c
says c
that c
' c
Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
' i
and c
who c
is c
happy c
only c
when c
can i
go c
shopping c
. c

In i
the c
first c
I c
do c
not c
think c
that c
shopping c
is c
enjoyable c
when c
you c
must c
do c
so i
in c
a c
hurry c
or c
for i
duty c
. c

If c
you c
have c
to c
run c
from c
one c
shop c
to c
another c
and i
always c
looking c
at c
the i
watch c
, c
doing i
shopping c
is c
a c
terrible c
activity c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
if c
you c
can c
walk c
without i
anytime i
problem c
with c
a c
good c
friend c
I c
think c
that c
shopping c
is c
very c
enjoyable c
. c

For c
istance i
, c
it c
is c
funny i
enter i
a c
clothes c
shop c
and c
try c
on c
a c
skirt c
or c
a c
t i
- c
shirt c
although c
you c
do c
not c
buy c
anything c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
I c
enjoy c
wasting c
money c
and i
buying c
useful c
things c
or c
not c
. c

I c
often c
like c
getting i
gifts c
for c
my c
relatives c
and c
friends c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
shopping c
is c
relaxing c
above i
all c
on c
Saturdays c
when c
you c
have c
finished c
a c
work i
week c
and c
you c
are c
expecting c
a c
wonderful c
Sunday c

Sorry c

I c
haven't c
written c
to c
you c
for c
such c
a c
long c
time c
, c
but c
I c
've c
got c
a c
good c
excute i
! c

Last c
month c
, c
I c
was i
partly c
in c
the c
concert c
teams c
. c

It c
was c
a c
big c
one c
that i
I c
never c
thougth c
and c
I c
could c
n't c
imagine i
how c
amazing c
was i
it c
. c

I c
did c
n't c
know c
what c
is i
my c
responsible i
until c
they c
called c
me c
to c
trained i
. c

What c
a c
surprised i
! c
and i
unbelieveable i
, c
I c
was c
responsible c
for c
looking c
after c
the c
pop c
stars c
. c

You c
might c
understand c
how c
excited c
I c
was c
. c

But c
, c
I c
've i
got c
though i
it c
. c
I c
have i
to c
taken i
care c
of c
them c
during c
a i
break c
, c
served i
a i
drink i
, c
clothes i
, c
even i
brought c
them c
some c
cigaratte i
and c
anything c
they c
wants i
. c

I c
think c
they c
are c
so c
hospitality i
and c
warm c
with c
people c
around c
them c
. c
You c
know c

are i
change i
all c
my c
opinions c
about c
self c
- c
important c
behavior c
of c
superstar c
. c

The i
most c
appreciated c
was c
they i
've i
given c
me c
their c
latate i
CD c
with c
signature i
. c
Marvellous c
thing c

during i
my i
summer c
holiday c
job c
. c

Love c
, c

Dear c
Mr c
, c

I c
am c
a c
foreign c
student c
who c
is c
on c
holidays i
here c
. c

I c
am c
going c
to c
stay c
here c
a i
week c
. c

I c
went c
to c
your c
theatre c
three c
days c
ago c
and c
it c
was c
horrible c
. c

I c
'm c
sorry c
but c
I c
am c
very c
dissapointed i
with c
the c
musical i
show c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
explain i
you i
my c
experience c
because c
I c
want c
you c
to c
give c
my i
money c
back c
. c

The i
last c
Monday c
, c
I c
went c
to c
the c
theatre c
with c
two c
friends c
. c

We c
arrived c
on c
time c
but c
the c
musical i
show c
was c
delayed c
untill i
half c
- c
pass i
eight c
. c

Moreover c
, c
we c
had i
n't c
any c
disscount i
for c
beeing i
students c
. c

On i
the c
other c
hand c
, c
the c
main c
actor c
was c
changed c
for c
another c
and c
nobody c
told c
us c
. c

When c
there c
was c
a i
restful i
we c
went c
to c
the c
restaurant c
which c
was c
closed c
because c
it c
was c
late c
. c

We c
could c
n't c
have c
a c
drink c
. c

Well c
I c
believe c
that c
it c
was c
a c
bad c
day c
but c
I c
would c
like c
you c
to c
give c
my i
money c
back c
because c
on i
the c
advertisement c
there c
was i
some c
things c
that c
we c
had i
n't c
in i
the c
theatre c
. c

Finally c
, c
it i
would c
be c
grateful c
if c
you c
could c
answer c
me c
soon c
. c

Yous i
sincerelly i
, c

Our c
lives c
are c
changing c
. c

When c
I c
was c
a c
child c
I c
had c
different c
entertainments i
that i
the i
actually i
children c
had i
n't c
. c

We c
could c
play c
with c
our c
toys c
, c
dolls c
and c
we c
could c
enjoy c
without i
a c
computer c
. c

We c
had c
n't c
so c
many c
machines c
than i
they c
have c
. c

The c
technology c
is c
growing c
and c
growing c
. c

If c
you c
have c
a c
computer c
you c
will c
be c
able c
to c
have c
all c
the c
information c
that c
you c
want c
. c

It c
's c
very c
important c
but c
some i
times c
it c
is c
a c
wrong i
thing c
because c
the c
children c
can c
see c
it c
too c
. c

Moreover c
you c
can c
change c
the c
TV c
programme c
without c
getting c
up c
. c

We c
can c
find c
information c
about c
the c
weather c
, i
sports c
on c
our c
TV c
- c
text c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
the i
science c
is c
changing c
. c

We c
have c
more c
researchers c
than c
some i
years c
ago c
and c
we c
will c
be c
able c
to c
find c
the c
solution c
of i
lots c
of c
problems c
. c

Actually c
, c
we c
can c
cure c
illness i
which c
were c
very i
dangerous c
before c
. c

I c
'm c
sure c
that c
in c
a c
couple c
of c
years c
we c
will c
see c
cured i
some c
illness c
like c
cancer c
, c
UTH c
. c

The c
new c
technology c
is c
changing c
our c
lives c
. c

Dear c
Madam c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
You i
in c
order c
to c
express c
my c
feelings c
about c
the c
International c
Arts c
Festival c
. c

I c
spent c
two c
days c
there c
, c
and c
I c
think c
it c
was c
the c
best c
Arts c
Festival c
I c
have c
ever c
been c
at i
. c

I c
also c
hope c
, i
that c
the c
festival c
could c
be c
even c
better c
next c
year c
. c

The c
great c
idea c
of c
making c
it c
" c
international c
" c
was c
unfortunately c
not c
brought c
to c
life c
, c
because c
the c
artists c
( c
mentioned i
to c
be c
" c
from c
around c
the c
world c
" c
) c
were c
from c
only c
six c
countries c
. c

Maybe c
the c
eason i
for c
that c
is c
very c
simple c
: c
lack c
of c
money c
? c

It c
would c
explain c
, i
why c
some c
concert c
halls c
were c
simply c
too c
small c
- c
you c
just c
could c
n't c
afford c
bigger c
ones c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
the c
wide c
range c
of c
plays c
and c
films c
to c
choose c
impressed i
me c
most i
. c

I c
thank c
you c
for c
organizing c
it c
, c
and c
hope c
to c
see c
more c
next c
year c
. c

I c
also c
thank c
you c
for c
the c
excellent c
idea c
of c
one i
ticket c
for c
all c
events c
, c
which c
allowed c
me c
to c
see c
all c
the c
things c
I c
was c
interested c
in c
. c

My c
suggestion c
for c
next c
year c
's c
festival c
is c
simple c
- c
please c
make c
it c
a c
few c
days c
longer c
! c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Dear c
Friend c
, c

Thank c
you c
for c
your c
last c
letter c
- c
I c
was c
very c
pleased c
to c
receive c
it c
. c

If c
you c
really c
want c
to c
hear c
about c
school c
rules c
in c
my c
country c
, c
I c
'll c
try c
to c
write c
about c
them c
in i
a c
nutshell c
. c

We c
do c
not c
have c
many c
school c
rules c
, c
and c
the c
teachers c
are c
rather c
liberal c
. c

We c
do c
n't c
have c
to c
wear c
any c
special c
uniforms c
on i
signs i
of c
our c
school c
. c

Some c
rules c
are c
really c
simple c
: c
we c
must c
be c
at c
school c
on c
time c
, c
and c
we c
must c
not c
disturb c
others c
during c
the i
classes c
. c

We c
are c
not c
allowed c
to c
smoke c
cigarettes c
or c
drink c
alcohol c
of c
course c
! c

In c
winters i
we c
are c
to c
change c
our c
shoes c
. c

It c
may c
sound c
funny c
, c
but c
mud c
, c
gravel c
and c
snow c
lying c
on c
the c
school c
's i
floors c
is c
not c
a c
nice c
sight c
, c
so c
we c
change c
our c
schoes i
without c
questioning c
that c
rule c
. c

I c
am c
also c
used c
to c
write i
exams c
which c
are c
in i
polish c
schools c
very c
often c
. c

At c
home c
I c
do c
n't c
have c
many c
rules c
either c
. c

I c
must c
wash c
the c
dishes c
from c
time c
to c
time c
( c
I c
sometimes c
try c
to c
avoid c
this c
unpleasant c
duty c
) c
and c
clean c
our c
house c
. c

I c
do c
n't c
think c
there c
is c
anything c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
change c
. c

I c
'm c
very c
pleased c
with c
my c
situation c
and c
I c
hope c
you c
are c
pleased c
with c
yours c
! c

Your i
faithfully c
, c

Dear c
Ms c
Helen i
Ryan c

I c
write i
to c
find c
out c
further c
information c
and c
give c
you c
some c
details c
about c
myself c
and c
the c
travel i
that c
I c
have c
won c
in c
your c
competition c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
inform c
you c
that c
I c
am c
able c
to c
travel c
only c
in c
July c
. i
Because c
, i
I c
am c
a c
student c
and c
in c
June c
, c
I c
will c
still c
have c
school c
. c

Also c
, c
in c
Augost i
I c
will c
be c
studying c
a c
summer c
English i
course c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
to c
stay c
in c
a c
tent c
. c

Because c
I c
would c
like c
to c
stay c
somewhere c
which c
differs c
from c
my c
home c
and c
every i
days c
comforts c
, c
in i
these c
two c
weeks c
. c

However c
, c
in c
your c
letter c
is i
written i
some c
activities c
. c
I c
would c
choose c
Basketball c
and c
Tennis c
. c

Basketball i
I c
have c
been c
playing c
in c
a c
team c
, i
of i
my c
town c
for c
ten c
years c
. c

Also c
Tennis i
is c
my c
favourite c
hobby c
and c
I c
play c
twice c
every i
week c
with c
my c
friends c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
would c
be c
grateful c
to c
you c
, i
if c
you c
told i
me c
about c
clothes c
and c
money c
. c

Will c
we c
need c
any c
special c
clothes c
and c
How i
much c
you i
would c
suggest c
me i
to i
carry c
for c
these c
two c
weeks c
? c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Dear c
Kim c

How c
are c
you c
? c

I c
am c
very c
well c
I i
'm c
writing c
to c
explain i
my c
experience c
with c
the c
pop c
concert c
; i
last c
month c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
think c
that c
I c
help i
them c
. c

Every c
day c
of c
that c
month c
I c
was c
trying c
to c
advertise c
this c
concert c
. c

I c
was c
going c
to c
markets c
to i
schools c
and c
I c
was c
giving c
information i
when i
and c
where c
the c
group c
was c
going c
to c
appear c
as c
well c
as c
where c
can i
they c
buy c
or c
book c
a c
ticket c
for c
this c
concert c
. c

I c
know c
, i
It i
was c
difficult c
and c
tired i
but c
I c
enjoyed c
a i
lot c
. c

Firstly c
, c
it c
was c
a c
good c
break c
from c
the c
routine i
. c

Because c
I c
did i
it c
for c
first i
time c
. c

Also c
, c
I c
felt c
wonderful c
when c
I c
saw c
, i
that c
the c
concert c
had i
succesed i
and c
every c
day c
was i
croweded i
. c

Because c
I c
believed c
that c
this c
was c
a c
result c
which c
came c
with i
my c
help c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
do c
again i
it c
in c
the c
future c
. c

It c
was c
a c
fantastic c
experience c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Best c
wishes c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
you c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
the c
programme c
you c
have c
organised c
. c

All c
students i
are c
very c
pleased c
and c
we c
are c
looking c
forward c
to c
go i
to c
London c
. c

We c
know c
we c
are c
going c
for c
three i
days c
, c
but c
we c
'll c
have c
enough c
time c
to c
use i
one c
of c
the c
bigger i
city i
in c
the c
world c
. c

London c
is c
the c
place c
to c
be c
when i
always i
something c
happening c
. c

We c
all i
very c
happy c
with c
your c
programme c
, c
especially i
we c
like c
the c
idea c
of c
sightseeing i
by c
our i
and c
National i
Art c
Gallery c
. c

The c
students c
in c
my c
class c
have c
seen c
an c
advertisement c
for c
the c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
, c
we i
would c
like c
to c
ask c
you c
if c
is i
possible c
to c
make c
some c
changes c
in i
the c
programme c
? i

The c
show c
is c
on c
Tuesday c
the i
14th c
between c
10.00- i
13.00 i
. c

We c
think c
is i
the i
great c
opportunity c
to c
see c
latest i
fashion i
, c
find i
about i
make c
up i
and c
hairstyles c
. c

And c
all c
of c
it c
is c
free c
, i

According c
to c
your c
programme c
we i
have c
the c
science i
Museum c
which c
is c
in c
the c
morning c
and c
then c
shopping c
. c

Would c
it c
be c
possible c
to c
go c
to c
the c
Museum c
and c
then c
for i
the c
shopping c
in c
our c
free c
time c
which i
is c
on c
Wednesday c
? c

All c
students i
will i
be c
very c
greatful i
. i

your i
sincerly i

I c
think c
for c
all c
of c
us c
home c
is c
something c
which c
is c
a i
very c
important c
. c

Home c
sweet c
home c
. c

We c
call c
home c
the c
place c
where c
we c
live c
or c
the c
country c
where c
we c
come c
frome i
. c

Anyway c
home c
is c
always c
the c
place c
to c
go c
because c
is i
ours c
we i
feel c
save i
and c
comfortable c
. i

Home c
sweet c
home c
. c

After c
hard c
work c
we i
want c
to c
go c
home c
to c
have c
our c
corner c
where c
we c
are c
all i
able c
to c
rest c
and c
relax c
. c

I c
think c
in c
the c
future c
home c
might c
be c
just c
the c
place c
to c
go c
to c
sleep c
. c

We c
live c
in c
the i
very c
busy c
world c
! c

Working c
long c
hours c
, c
doing c
plenty c
of c
activieties i
, c
going c
out c
, c
going c
on c
holidays c
. c

We c
even i
do c
n't c
spend c
time c
with c
families i
. c

Propably i
in c
the c
future c
we c
might i
be c
to i
busy c
to c
go c
to c
our c
own c
home c
and c
spend c
some c
time c
there c
. c

But c
in i
the c
end c
of c
the c
day c
it c
alway i
will c
be c
place i
to c
go c
! c
We c
find c
our c
family c
there c
and c
our c
life c
. c

Some c
of c
us c
have c
been c
living c
in c
one i
house c
since c
they i
were c
born c
. c

We c
are c
sentimental c
and c
we c
have c
memory i
from c
the c
past c
. c
I c
think c
it c
's c
a c
part c
of c
our c
life.lf i

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show c
. i

Over c
the c
Rainbow c
, c
which c
you c
advertised c
. c

I c
saw c
the c
show c
at c
your c
theatre c
with c
my c
friend c
on c
6th c
June c
. c

However c
, c
I c
was c
disappointed c
with c
something i
which c
did c
not c
match c
your c
advertisement c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
have c
seen c
Danny c
Brook c
as c
I c
am c
keen c
on c
his c
play i
. c

He c
did c
not c
play i
in i
the i
evening c
. c

It c
made c
me c
sad c
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
starting c
time c
has c
been c
changed c
from c
19:30 c
to c
20:15 c
. c

We c
waited c
for c
ages c
because c
we c
had c
not c
been c
informed c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
although c
you c
advertised c
the i
discounts i
tickets c
available i
, c
they c
do c
not c
sale i
them c
any c
more c
according c
to c
your c
staff c
. c

Finally c
, c
we c
went c
to c
the c
restaurant c
in c
your c
theater i
after c
the c
show c
. c

It c
was c
closed c
because c
of c
the c
staff c
trainning i
. c

I c
am c
sure c
you c
can c
understand c
my c
disappointment c
. c
I c
must c
insist c
that c
you c
refund c
the c
cost c
of c
the c
show c
. c

Unless c
I c
hear c
from c
you c
within c
ten c
days c
, c
I c
shall c
have c
to c
take c
legal c
advice c
on c
the i
matter c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
in c
the c
near c
future c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

It c
is c
believed c
that c
our c
life i
style c
has c
been c
changed c
by c
mordern i
technology c
such c
as c
computers c
and c
washing c
machine i
etc c
. c

Especially c
for c
families c
. c

I c
have c
found c
very i
expensive c
to c
buy c
them c
but c
there c
are c
number i
of c
advantages c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
dishwashers c
are c
very c
effecient i
for c
me c
because c
I c
work c
full c
time i
and c
look c
after c
my c
children c
. c

It c
is c
very c
difficult c
to c
cook c
and c
wash c
dishes c
after c
working c
. c

Before c
buying c
my c
dishwasher c
I c
asked c
my c
son c
to c
wash c
them c
. c

He c
complained c
about c
a i
lot c
. c

Secondly c
, c
computers c
are c
useful c
for c
us c
as c
well c
, c
because c
we c
do c
not c
need c
to c
go c
somewhere c
if c
we c
want c
to c
have i
information c
, c
for c
example c
traveling i
. c

However c
my i
family c
's i
members c
do c
less i
communicate c
with c
each c
other c
than c
we i
used c
to c
, c
because c
my c
children c
are c
keen c
on c
playing c
computer c
games c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
the i
morden i
technology c
make i
our c
life c
style i
combinient i
. c

It c
is c
very c
good c
for c
us c
but c
I c
think c
we c
should c
think c
about i
more c
carefully c
when c
we c
buy c
something c
for c
our c
children c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
my c
horrible c
evening c
at c
The c
Circle c
Theatre c
on c
10th c
June c
2000 c
. c

Last c
week c
I c
was c
on c
holiday c
in c
London c
and c
I c
went c
to c
the c
theatre c
for c
entertaining i
but c
I c
wish c
I c
'd c
not c
go i
there c
because c
everythings i
went c
wrong c
. c

I c
bought c
a c
ticket c
at c
the c
box c
office c
but c
there c
were c
not c
any c
discounts c
for c
student i
like c
you c
said c
in c
the c
advertisement c
for c
the c
show c
and c
also c
the c
show c
had i
to c
start c
at c
19.30 c
but c
on c
that c
day c
it c
delaied i
about c
45 c
minutes c
. c

During c
the c
show c
I c
was i
expected c
to c
meet i
Danny c
Brook c
who i
is c
my c
favourite c
actor c
and i
Tina c
Truelove c
. c

There c
are i
Robert c
Alan c
and c
Jack c
Ruby c
instead c
of c
them c
. c

It c
really c
disappointed c
me c
. c

After c
finishing i
the c
show c
I c
wanted c
to c
visit c
your c
restaurant c
and c
I c
found c
that c
it c
was c
closed c
. c

It i
was c
a c
sign c
in c
front c
of c
the c
restaurant c
" i
sorry c
we c
closed i
because i
special c
reasons c
" c
and i
I c
was c
wondering c
what c
was i
the c
reasons c
for c
that c
. c

Finally c
I i
would c
like c
to c
have c
refund i
for c
my c
ticket c
back i
because c
it c
was c
horrible i
evening c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Paya c
Chuaswee c
( c
Miss c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
that i
why i
our c
great c
plan c
for c
horiday i
were i
not c
be i
real c
. c

It c
happened c
in i
last c
summer c
we i
planed i
to c
go c
on c
holiday c
in c
the c
Southen i
part c
of c
Thailand c
by c
motorbike c
but c
we c
could c
n't c
tell c
our c
parents c
because c
they c
would c
n't c
allow c
us c
to c
go c
. c

We c
started c
our c
journey c
and c
we c
arrived c
at c
our c
purpose i
place c
by c
6 c
o'clock c
in c
the c
evening c
. c

The c
sun c
was c
shining c
and c
wind i
were i
breezing i
like c
we c
had c
imaged i
. c

Whlile i
I c
was c
standing c
on c
the c
beach c
suddenly i
I c
heard c
someone c
called i
my c
name c
and c
said i
that c
I c
had c
to c
go c
home c
, i
that c
right i
, c
she i
is i
my c
mum c
. c

She c
told c
me c
Pat c
had c
phoned c
her c
while c
we c
were c
going i
and c
my c
mum c
followed c
us c
because c
it c
was c
so c
dangerous c
to c
went i
by c
bicycle c
. c

Eventhrough i
we c
could c
spend c
our c
holiday c
there c
but c
with c
my c
mum c
and c
I c
just c
found c
that c
it c
was c
fantasy c
time c
which c
I c
had c
never c
though i
about c
it c
. c

From c
now c
on c
I i
do c
n't c
want c
to c
tell c
something i
secrets c
to c
Pat c
because c
she c
always c
tell i
someone c
else c
but c
she c
still i

best c
friend c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
reply c
to c
your c
letter c
I c
received c
yestarday i
. c

I c
am c
very c
proud c
that c
I c
won c
first c
prize c
in c
your c
competition c
and c
I c
am c
extremely c
happy c
to c
spend c
two c
weeks c
at c
Camp c
California c
in c
the c
U.S.A. c

At c
the c
beginning c
I c
would c
like c
to c
answer c
questions i
you c
asked c
me c
in c
your c
letter c
. c

The c
most c
appropriate i
month c
for c
me c
to c
travel c
is c
July c
because c
my c
boss c
promised c
to c
give c
me c
this c
month c
off c
( c
I c
am c
in c
charge c
of c
project i
which c
starts c
in c
June c
so c
I c
am c
sure c
I c
could c
n't c
go c
later c
) c
. c

' c
As c
I c
have c
a c
choise i
I c
would c
prefer c
to c
stay c
in c
log c
cabins c
to i
tents c
because c
they c
seem c
to c
be c
more c
comfortable c
and c
you c
are c
not c
so c
depended i
on c
weather c
conditions c
. c

As c
I c
was c
requested c
I c
should c
choose c
two c
activities c
from c
the c
list c
. c

So c
I c
decided c
to c
choose c
climbing c
and c
photography c
. c

These c
two c
are c
easy c
to c
connect c
, c
I c
could c
climb c
and c
make c
pictures c
at c
the c
same c
time c
. c

I c
am c
very c
keen c
on c
photography c
. c

Last c
year c
I c
took c
part c
in c
photograher i
's c
contest c
and c
I c
won c
a c
second c
prize c
in c
Poland c
in c
cathegory i
of c
, c
, c
beautiful c
scenery c
'' c
. c

Climbing c
, c
in c
contrast c
, c
is c
something c
I c
started c
few i
months c
ago c
, c
so c
I c
have c
not c
gained c
any c
success c
in c
this c
sport c
. c

But c
you c
could c
give c
me c
a c
chance c
to c
get c
more c
familier i
with c
it c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
about c
clothes c
. c

Do c
I c
need c
any c
formal c
ones c
? c

I c
would c
like i
also c
to c
know c
what c
the c
cost c
of c
spending c
two c
weeks c
in c
the c
U.S.A. c
is c
. c

I c
want c
to c
thank c
you c
ones i
more c
for c
taking i
me c
into c
consideration c
in c
your c
competition c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Juliana c
Piotrowska c

Have c
you c
ever c
been c
to c
a c
big c
supermarket c
and c
tried c
to c
find c
something c
you c
really c
like c
or c
want c
, c
looking c
throug i
shelves c
and c
not c
finding c
that c
in c
the c
end c
. c

What c
did c
you c
feel c
? c

You c
had c
to c
be c
disappointed c
. c

There c
is i
a c
lot c
of c
situations c
which c
could c
make c
you c
feel c
similar c
while c
you c
do c
shopping c
. c

You c
might c
spend c
too c
much c
money c
and c
buy c
something c
you c
do c
n't c
really c
need c
. c

You c
could c
also c
buy c
something c
which c
later c
turns c
out c
to c
be c
out i
of c
order c
. c

So c
you c
have c
to c
complain c
about c
it c
. c

Very c
often c
a c
shop c
assistant c
is c
not c
helpful c
so c
you c
lose c
your c
money c
and c
your c
time c
. c

Moreover c
, c
you c
could c
face c
an c
agressive i
and c
maybe c
even c
drunk c
shop c
assistant c
or c
manager c
. c

This c
leads c
to c
an c
escalation c
of c
your c
anger c
. c

Sometimes c
you c
could c
find c
a c
bargain c
. c

You c
are c
happy c
to c
buy c
a c
dress c
or c
a c
suit c
for c
a c
good c
price c
. c

But c
at c
home c
you c
noticed i
that c
there c
is c
a c
tear c
on c
sleeve i
. c

And c
you c
could c
n't c
of c
course c
give i
it c
back c
because c
the c
price c
was c
lowered c
and c
your c
dress c
is c
not c
under c
guarantee c
. c

You c
could c
also c
face c
an c
unpleasant c
situation c
connected c
with c
money c
. c

Somebody c
could c
give c
you c
not c
enough c
change c
. c

How c
would c
you c
feel c
? c
Deceived c
? c

So c
if c
you c
do c
n't c
want c
to c
feel c
deceived c
or c
offended c
, c
think c
twice c
before c
you c
decide c
to c
go c
shopping c
. c

( c
A c
very c
depressing c
point c
of c
view c
, c
is c
n't c
it c
? c
) c

Dear c
Sir c
, c

I c
would c
like c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
show c
which c
you c
presented c
on i
last c
saturday i
. c

It c
was c
such c
disappointing i
evening c
out c
with c
my c
friend c
during c
our c
a i
week c
's c
holiday c
in c
London c
. c

We c
have c
had c
a c
quite c
pleasant c
time c
except c
the i
evening c
. c

Actually c
it c
spoiled c
our c
time c
. c

So c
I c
would c
like c
to c
get c
back c
our c
money c
. c

These c
are c
some c
points c
I c
want c
mention i
about c
the c
differencies i
between c
the i
advertisement c
said c
and c
the c
realities c
. c

First c
, c
I c
had c
a c
great c
expectation c
to c
see c
Danny c
Brook c
plays i
his c
role c
, c
but c
he c
had c
never c
shown c
up c
that c
night c
. c

The c
main c
actor c
was c
an c
unknown c
actor c
. c

It c
was c
a i
such c
disappointing i
. c

Second c
, c
it c
started i
only c
at c
20:15 c
. c

It c
was c
45 c
minutes c
later c
than c
it c
suppose i
to c
be c
. c

It c
was c
a i
such i
boaring i
to c
wait c
the i
show c
in c
a c
noisy c
and c
hot c
theatre c
. c

Third c
, c
there c
was c
no c
possibility c
of c
discount i
. c

The c
girl c
sold i
the c
tickets c
was c
laughing c
at c
me c
when c
I c
mention i
about c
the i
discounts c
availability c
was c
written c
in c
the c
advertisement c
. c

Forth i
, c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
. c

There c
was c
a c
not i
on c
the c
door c
saying c
that c
the i
painting c
was c
going c
on c
the i
weekend c
. c

How c
could c
you c
arrange c
work c
like c
that c
? c

Finally c
the i
sentence c
was i
written c
blow i
down c
on c
the c
advertisement c
was c
absolutely c
not c
true c
. c

It c
was c
most i
imperfect c
evening c
out c
I c
ever c
exprienced i
. c

I c
wish i
that c
you c
can c
provide c
a c
better c
service c
next c
time c
, c
and c
this c
time c
you c
need c
give i
back c
the c
money c
we c
paid c
. c

Sincerely c

Yu c
Phu c
Tung c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Since c
I c
moved c
to c
London c
to c
study c
English c
I c
have c
had c
a c
hard c
time c
to i
make c
intimate c
friendship i
with c
people c
around c
me c
. c

First c
it c
was c
because c
of c
the c
culture c
difference c
. c

It c
took c
quite c
long i
time c
to c
adjust c
in i
the c
multi i
culture c
in c
the c
language c
institue i
. c

Secondly c
the c
language c
ability c
was c
another c
issue c
. c

Even c
I i
could c
meet c
some c
friend c
, c
but i
I c
could c
n't c
express c
my c
heat i
to c
them c
for i
we c
have c
different c
back i
ground c
and c
our c
first c
language i
were c
different c
. c

I c
really c
wished c
to c
have c
a c
friend c
can i
share c
everything c
is i
going c
in i
our c
lives c
. c

Finally c
I c
met c
Pat c
. c

She c
was c
a i
such c
wonderful c
person c
in c
our c
class c
. c

She c
tried c
to c
help c
others c
when c
they c
have i
difficult i
time c
at c
school c
. c

One c
day c
she c
realized c
that c
I c
was c
always c
been i
outside c
of c
circle i
. c

One c
day c
she c
invited c
me c
to c
her c
flat c
. c

Since c
then c
we c
have c
visited c
each c
other c
often c
and c
spent c
time c
together c
in i
weekend i
usally i
. c

We c
had c
a c
fantastic c
time c
together c
for c
three c
monthes i
. c

Even i
we c
could c
make c
a c
trip c
to c
Paris c
in c
the c
school c
holiday c
! c

We c
had c
many c
common c
interests c
in c
music c
, c
art c
and c
books c
. c

I c
thought c
that c
I c
found i
a c
good c
friend c
in c
my c
life c
. c

So c
I c
told c
her c
everything c
about c
my c
life c
. c

There c
were c
some c
stories c
I c
never c
told c
anyone c
before c
, c
but c
I c
had i
share c
with c
her c
all c
my c
secrets c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Few i
days c
later i
I c
told c
her c
about c
my c
secret c
love c
story c
, c
it c
became c
a i
top c
gossip c
among c
my c
classmate i
. c

It c
was c
a c
nightmare c
! c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
madam c
, c

Thank c
you c
for c
your c
letter c
and c
your c
congratulations c
. c

I c
never c
thought c
that c
I c
would c
win c
the c
competition c
. c

It c
is c
really c
wonderful c
. c

I c
can c
stay c
at c
Camp c
California c
in c
the c
U.S.A. c
for c
two c
weeks c
. c

I c
am c
a c
student c
at c
Portsmouth c
College c
and c
the c
end c
of c
this c
term c
is c
23 c
June c
, c
so c
I c
can c
only c
travel c
in c
July c
. c

I c
wonder c
if c
it c
is c
all c
right c
for i
that c
time c
. c

And c
for i
my c
accommodation c
. i

I c
prefer i
live i
in c
a c
log c
cabin c
, c
because c
it c
is c
more c
comfortable c
. c

I c
like i
to c
relax c
there c
and c
enjoy c
the c
atmosphere c
when i
I c
live i
in i
. c

I c
like c
to c
do c
some c
activities c
in c
water c
and c
my c
favourite c
activity c
is c
swimming c
. c

Before c
I c
came c
England i
, c
I c
swam c
every c
weekend c
in c
my c
country c
even i
in c
winter c
, c
so c
I c
choose c
to c
do c
some c
swimming c
and c
sailing c
while c
I c
am c
at c
the c
camp c
. c

Actually c
, c
my c
mind c
has c
already c
gone c
there c
, i
I c
ca c
n't c
wait c
even c
for c
a c
minute c
. c

I c
want c
to c
go c
there c
now c
. c

By c
the c
way c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
the i
shopping c
especially i
for c
clothes c
, i
I c
want c
to c
buy c
some c
for c
myself c
. c

And c
do c
you c
think c
I c
need c
to c
exchange c
money c
before c
I c
go c
there c
? c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
your c
letter c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

In c

an c
active c
member c
of c
Sailing i
and c
Surfing c
Club c

great c
chance c

and c
skills c
. c

Yours c

As c
requested c
, c
I c
visited c
some c
classes c
during c
the i
lesson i
and c
some c
other c
rooms c
while c
activities c
were c
taking c
place c
. c

The c
aim c
of c
this c
report c
is c
make i
a c
series c
of c
suggestions c
on c
which c
lessons c
and c
other c
activities c
should c
be c
filmed c
. c

It c
's i
seems c
to c
me c
that c
it c
will c
be c
an c
extremely c
good c
advertisement c
for c
our c
school c
if c
you c
take i
plans c
from c
the c
lesson i
of c
Chemistry c
in c
the c
laboratory c
, c
because c
our c
laboratory c
is c
new c
, c
recognised c
as c
one c
of c
the c
best c
in c
the c
area c
as c
it c
has c
a c
huge c
amount c
of c
instruments i
and c
really c
some c
very c
good c
professors i
, c
and c
also c
many c
experiments c
are c
taking c
place c
in c
this c
laboratory c

Furthermore c
, c
I c
think c
it c
will c
be c
a c
good c
idea c
to c
take i
plans c
from c
a c
match c
of c
our c
school c
team c
in i
the c
football c
field i
as c
it c
is c
completely c
new c
and c
full i
equiped i
. c

In c
addition c
, c
I c
think c
you c
have i
to c
take c
also c
plans c
from c
the c
school c
's c
Nursery i
as c
there c
are c
a c
lot c
of c
facilities c
for c
the c
children c
, c
and c
the c
parents c
can c
recognise i
that c
the c
teachers c
are c
very c
good c
. c

I c
think i
also c
that c
will i
be c
a c
good c
idea c
to c
take c
some c
general c
plans i
of c
the c
school c
area c
as c
there c
is c
a c
huge c
background i
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
I c
have c
to c
declare c
that c
my i
myself i
and c
my c
fellow c
students c
will c
be c
available c
to c
help c
to i
this c
short c
video c
by i
all c
means c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
delightful i
to c
receive c
your c
letter c
saying c
that c
I c
have c
won c
a c
two c
- c
week c
holiday c
in c
your c
recent c
competition c
and c
it c
will c
all c
paid i
in i
advance c
. c

I c
am c

this c
letter c
so c
as c

the c
information c
which c
will c
help c
you c
organize i
all c
the c
necessary c
details c
of c
the c
forthcoming c
holiday c
. c

I c
would c
be c
grateful c
if c
you c
could c
arrange c
a c
date c
after c
the c
20th c
of c
July c
, c
due c
to c
the i
problems c
beyond c
my c
control c
. c

Otherwise c
I c
will c
not c
be c
able c
to c
travel c
abroad c
. c

I c
would c
rather c
stay c
in c
one c
of c
the c
log c
cabins c
as c
I c
am c
allergic c
to c
many c
plants c
and c
insects c
and c
I c
should c
avoid c
contacting i
them c
. c

It c
is c
wonderful c
to c
hear c
that c
there c
is c
a c
good c
variety c
of c
activities c
available c
at c
the c
camp c
. c

As c
I c
am c
very c
interested c
in c
photography c
and c
swimming c
I c
am c
hoping c
to c
take c
part c
in c
them i
. c

I c
came c
second c
last i
year c
's c
swimming c
competition c
and c
I c
have c
enrolled c
photography i
classes c
. c

In i
the c
camp c
I c
can c
practise c
them c
alot i
. c

I c
was c
wondering c
if c
I c
need c
to c
bring c
some c
extra c
money c
and c
thick c
clothes c
with c
me c
in c
case c
there c
is c
an c
emergency c
. c

Could c
you c
please c
let c
me c
know c
as c
soon c
as c
you c
receive c
my c
letter c
. i

Yours c
faithfully c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

I c
am c
terribly c
sorry c
not c
to c
drop c
you c
a c
line c
since c
the c
last c
time c
we c
wrote c
to c
one c
another c
. c

But c
I c
finally i
got c
around c
writing i
and c
you c
'll c
see c
that c
it c
's c
definetly i
worth c
waiting c
as i
I c
have c
some c
great c
and c
unbeliavable i
news c
to c
tell c
you c
. c

As c
you c
know c
I c
'm c
on c
half c
- c
term c
school c
holiday c
and c
have c
plenty c
of c
time c
to c
do c
much i
more c
different i
things c
apart c
from c
studying c
my c
A c
- c
level c
history c
, c
such c
as c
meeting c
up c
my i
friends c
, c
visiting c
interesting c
places c
or c
even c
going c
to c
the c
cinema c
on c
my c
own c
. c

However c
this i
term c
has c
been c
a c
far c
cry c
from c
the c
others c
. c

You c
will c
see c
why c
I c
'm c
describing c
it c
as c
the c
most c
unforgettible i
one c
when c
you c
read c
through c
my c
letter c
. c

Couple i
of c
days c
ago c
I c
bumped c
into c
my c
best c
friend c
who i
is c
into c
music c
and i
we c
started c
to c
have c
a c
chat c
about c
what c
we c
had c
both c
been c
doing c
. c

She c
invited c
me c
to c
the c
rehearsal c
of c
a c
huge c
consert i
whose i
singer c
was i
a c
well c
- c
known c
pop c
star c
as c
well c
as c
my c
favorite i
. c

Can c
you c
believe c
that c
I c
was c
introduced c
to c
him c
and c
I c
took c
numerous c
photographs c
some i
of c
which c
I c
put c
in c
the c
envelope c
. c

It c
was c
like c
a c
dream c
come c
true c
, c
and c
was c
the c
best c
part c
of c
the c
experience c
in c
my c
opinion c
. c

I c
helped c
out c
my c
friend c
by c
writing c
huge c
billboards c
and c
making c
some c
light c
refreshments c
. c

Despite c
the c
fact c
that c
I c
felt c
exhausted c
I c
must c
admit c
that c
it c
was c
one c
of c
the c
days c
I c
will c
never c
forget c
througout i
my c
life i

write i
me i
soon c
. c

Yours i
sincerely c

Dear c
Mr. c
Robertson c
, c

The c
trip c
that c
you c
planned i
for c
us c
, i
students c
, i
it i
's c
a c
great c
chance c
to c
meet c
new c
people c
and c
visit c
a c
beautiful c
city c
like i
London c
. c

Your c
programme c
is c
excellent c
because c
it c
tries c
to c
offer c
to i
the c
students c
the c
best c
way c
to c
spend c
our i
time c
without c
wasting c
time c
in i
silly c
places c
or c
events c
. c

We c
'd c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
because c
the i
kind c
of c
happening i
shows c
how c
you i
are c
dedicated c
with i
our c
school c
and c
the c
students c
that c
study c
there c
. c

It c
's c
great i
to c
visit c
especially c
the c
Science c
Museum c
because i
of c
its c
expositions i
. c

But c
there c
's c
something c
that c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
ask c
. c

The c
London c
fashion i
and c
Leisure c
Show c
will c
start c
on c
Tuesday c
. c

It c
's c
a c
great c
opportunity c
for c
us c
because c
there c
will c
be c
expositions i
of c
the c
latest c
fashions c
, c
of c
the c
new c
hairstyles c
, c
of i
the c
new c
leisure c
and c
sports c
clothes c
and c
people c
teaching c
how c
to c
make i
up i
. c

Our c
suggestion c
is c
that c
you c
could c
change c
the i
day c
of c
the c
leisure c
time c
to c
the c
shopping c
in c
the c
afternoon c
. c

By i
this c
way c
, c
the c
leisure c
time c
would c
be c
on c
Tuesday c
and c
we c
would c
be c
able c
to c
go c
to c
the c
London c
Fashion c
. i

Thanks c
for c
the i
attention c
and c
we c
're c
waiting c
for c
your c
answer c
. c

Yours c
faithfully i
, c

Famous c
People c
x i
Media i

Famous c
people c
are c
special c
for i
the c
rest c
of c
the i
society c
. c

They c
form c
opinions c
and c
invent c
new c
fashion c
styles c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
the c
media c
is c
expanding c
its c
ways i
of c
communication c
so c
they c
need c
more c
information c
. c
The c
media c
is c
starting c
to c
get i
into c
the c
private c
life c
of c
these c
famous c
people c
. c

It c
's c
important c
to c
respect c
other c
people c
lives i
because c
it i
can c
cause c
serious c
problems c
in i
the c
family c
of c
the c
person c
or c
in c
his c
life c
. c

If c
the c
famous c
person c
does c
n't c
mind c
in i
being c
filmed c
in c
his c
personal c
life c
there c
's c
no c
problem c
. c

But c
if c
the c
politicians c
or c
the c
film c
stars c
ask c
for c
privacity i
the c
media c
has c
to c
respect c
. i

Everybody c
likes c
to c
be c
with c
your i
family c
without c
any c
reporter c
or c
photographer c
. i

In c
summary c
, c
the c
best c
thing c
to c
do c
is c
try c
to c
extract c
from c
these c
people c
their c
best c
qualities c
and c
not c
try c
to c
find c
things c
that c
could c
irritate c
them c
like c
familiar i
problems c
or c
personal c
problems c
. c

The i
respect c
is c
essential c
. c

They c
deserve c
to c
have c
a c
private c
life c
like c
any c
common i
person c
. c

Dear c
Mr i
/ c
Mss c

I c
'm c
writing c
you i
in i
complain i
about c
musical i
show c
, i
that c
I c
have i
visited c
last c
evening c
. c

I c
had c
a c
week c
holiday i
in c
London c
, c
so c
I c
wanted c
to c
spend c
my c
last c
evening c
with i
great c
pleasure c
, c
however c
it c
was c
the c
worse i
evening c
in c
my c
life c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
the c
actors c
were c
different c
from c
those c
who c
were c
advertised c
. c

Second c
, c
the c
show c
started c
at c
20:15 c
, c
althoug i
I c
read c
that c
it c
started i
at c
19:30 c
! c

More i
over c
after i
watching c
a i
show c
I c
wanted c
to c
visit c
your c
theatre c
restaurant c
, c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
, c
it c
really c
disappointed c
me c
. c

It c
was c
my c
dream c
to c
see c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
, c
so c
it c
is c
still c
my c
dream c
because c
of c
your c
show c
. c

So c
, c
I c
had c
no c
perfect c
evening c
out c
and c
I c
want c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
'll c
understand c
my c
situation c
and c
if c
you c
want c
other c
people c
to c
visit c
your c
show c
, c
you c
should c
return c
my c
money c
. c

Yours c
faithfuly i

How c
has c
modern c
techology i
changed c
my c
daily c
life c
. i

Fifty c
years c
ago c
people c
even i
did c
n't c
think c
that c
after c
2000 c
years c
they c
would c
have c
another c
life c
. c

When c
Thomas c
Adison c
invented c
an i
electric c
light c
, c
it c
was c
the c
greatest c
invention c
for c
people c
of c
that c
centure i
. c

And c
nowadays c
modern c
technology c
can c
change c
all c
our c
life i
. c

I c
mean c
, c
almost c
everyone c
has i
now c
a c
car c
, c
a c
computer c
, c
a c
mobil i
phone c
and c
even c
an c
airplane c
. c

My c
life c
is c
changing c
too c
. c

First c
of c
all c
now i
I c
can c
phone c
my c
friends c
and c
parents c
from c
every c
place c
, c
I c
can c
chat c
with c
other c
foreign c
teenagers c
with c
the c
help c
of c
the c
internet i
. c

Second c
modern i
technology c
helps c
me c
in c
the c
kitchen c
. c

Coocking i
became i
faster c
with c
the c
help c
of c
the c
microwave c
. c

What c
is c
more c
Modern i
technology c
prevents c
different c
illnesses c
. c

Further i
more c
, c
yesterday c
I c
've i
heard c
that c
every c
man c
could c
fly c
to i
the i
space c
without c
any c
experience c
, c
it c
is c
great c
, c
from c
my c
point c
of c
view c
in i
2050 i
year c
everybody c
will c
fly c
to i
the i
space c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
people i
can c
atrophided i
of c
all c
this i
inventions c
. c

He i
become c
lazy c
because c
they c
know c
that c
they c
can c
seat i
on c
the c
sofa c
and c
turn i
the c
chances i
on c
the c
TV c
by c
pressing c
a c
boton i
. c

In c
conclusion c
I i
want c
to c
say c
that c
inspite i
of c
this c
, c
I c
hope c
that c
in c
future c
we c
will c
have c
more c
and c
more c
new c
inventions c
and c
they c
will c
stop i
our c
disasters c
and c
problems c
. c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c

First c
of c
all c
I c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
the c
good c
programme c
you c
organised i
for c
our c
trip c
to c
London c
. c

Especially i
the c
sightseeing c
by c
bus c
seems i
to c
be c
very c
interesting c
. c

But c
we c
would c
like c
to c
suggest c
you i
something c
: c
There i
is c
a c
trendy c
event c
about c
the c
latest c
fashions c
, c
leisure c
and c
sports c
wear c
; i
make c
up i
and c
hairstyles c
on i
the c
14th c
of c
March c
. c

It c
is c
called c
, i
, c
The c
London c
Fashion c
and c
Leisure c
Show c
. c
" c

This c
would c
be c
a c
great c
opportunity c
because i
we c
are c
all c
intrested i
in c
clothes c
, c
sports c
and c
fashion c
. c

I c
have i
almost c
forgotten c
to c
mention c
that c
it c
is c
free c
for c
students c
! c

Unfortunately c
we c
realised i
that c
on c
the c
14th c
we c
will i
already c
visit c
the c
Science c
Museum c
. c

The c
show c
lasts c
nine c
hours c
, c
from c
10.00 c
- c
19.00 c
, c
the c
whole c
day c
! c

Our c
question c
now c
: i
Could i
we c
go c
to c
this c
show c
? c

We c
could c
maybe c
change c
Tuesday c
's c
programme c
to c
Wednesday c
. c

We c
all i
prefer c
the i
show c
, i
free c
time c
is c
not c
so c
important c
for c
us c
. c

Please c
think c
about c
this c
and c
give c
us c
an c
answer c
. c

Thanks c
. c

Yours c
faithfully i

Dear c
Jack c

Thanks c
a c
lot c
for c
your c
letter c
. c

I c
am c
fine c
but c
quite c
busy c
because c
I c
have c
my c
German c
exams c
. c

Therefore c
I c
read c
Agatha c
Christie c
's c
, i
, c
Best c
Detective c
Stories c
of c
Agatha c
Christie c
" c
. c

I c
can c
really c
recommend c
you i
this c
book c
, i
it c
is c
fabulous c
. c

It c
is c
also c
a c
suitable c
present c
for c
your c
cousin c
, c
I c
think c
. c

One c
story c
is c
about c
ten c
persons i
who c
stay c
together c
in c
a c
hotel c
on c
a c
lonely c
island c
. c

There c
is c
a c
storm c
and c
they c
can c
not c
leave c
. c

Suddenly c
a c
murderer i
happens i
! c

Believe c
me c
, c
you c
would c
never c
guess c
who c
the c
killer c
is c
! c

There c
is c
also c
Hercule c
Poirot c
, c
the c
famous c
detective c
and i
he c
finally c
solves c
the c
mistery i
. c

But c
I c
will c
not c
tell c
you c
more i
. c

You c
have c
to c
read c
it c
yourself c
. c

And c
if c
your c
cousin c
likes c
crime c
stories c
it c
is c
a c
perfect c
book c
! c

Unfortunately c
it c
is c
quite c
expensive c
, c
£ c
32 c
. c

But c
do c
not c
worry c
about c
the c
price c
because c
your c
cousin c
will c
love c
it c
! c

Okay c
, c
I c
hope c
to c
have c
news c
from c
you c
very c
soon c
. c

Have c
a c
good c
time c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
: c

Thank c
you c
for c
telling c
me c
that c
I c
have c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
and c
now c
I c
am c
writing c
to c
tell i
you c
the c
information c
you c
have c
requested c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
think c
I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
, c
which c
will c
be c
the c
only c
month c
for i
me c
to c
go c
. c

Because c
my c
course c
wo c
n't c
finish c
until c
the c
end c
of c
June c
, c
and c
I c
will c
have c
to c
stay c
in c
the c
college c
to c
get c
ready c
for c
the c
new c
term c
. c

Then c
I c
'd c
like c
to c
choose c
the c
tents c
for c
my c
accommodation c
when c
at c
Camp c
California c
. c

I c
think c
sleeping c
in c
a c
tent c
is c
funnier i
than c
others i
. i

However i
, c
during c
my c
stay c
at c
Camp c
, c
there c
are c
two c
activities c
I c
can c
choose c
, i
one c
of c
them c
I c
will c
choose c
Basketball c
because c
it c
is c
the c
sport c
I c
play c
most c
, i
I c
and c
my c
friend c
used c
to c
win c
the c
first c
place i
in c
school i
- c
wide c
match c
when c
we c
was i
in i
school c
. c

And c
the i
other c
one c
, c
I c
think c
painting c
will c
be c
a c
good c
idea c
; c
Painting i
is c
one c
of c
my c
hobbies c
and c
I c
've c
been c
learning i
it c
since c
I c
was c
5 c
years c
old c
and c
now c
I c
'm c
still c
doing c
it c
once i
I c
have c
free i
time c
. c

Above c
are i
all c
the c
information c
you c
asked c
, i
however c
, c
here i
are c
something i
I c
'd c
like c
to c
know c
; c
first i
is c
about c
the c
clothes c
, i
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
I i
need c
to c
take c
with c
? i

And c
another c
question c
is c
what c
is i
the c
prices c
of c
things c
like c
in i
there c
, c
so i
that c
I c
can c
make c
a c
better c
buget i
of i
my c
trip c
. c

Look i
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Dear c
Kim c
: c

Thanks c
for c
your c
last c
letter c
; c
I c
knew c
you c
would c
interested i
at i
my c
experience c
of c
helping c
the i
pop c
concert c
last i
time c
, i
now c
I c
tell i
you c
about c
it c
. c

The c
place c
we i
worked c
was c
a c
football c
pitch c
; c
we c
spent c
3 c
days c
on i
setting c
up c
the c
stage c
, c
the c
equitment i
, c
and c
the c
lights c
. c

In c
fact c
, c
there c
is i
nothing c
very c
important c
I c
did c
, c
because c
we c
are i
not c
the c
right c
people c
to c
do c
it c
. c

I c
only c
put c
the c
speakers c
in c
the c
right c
places c
, c
or c
helping i
engieners i
tested i
the c
lights c
. c

But c
at i
the c
brakes i
and c
after c
work c
, c
I c
had c
a c
chance c
to c
talk c
with c
the c
engieners i
, c
and c
I c
leant i
something c
about c
setting c
up c
the c
equitment i
. c

The c
fourth c
day c
, c
the c
singers c
and c
the c
players i
have i
been c
to i
there c
to c
test i
. c

Then c
I c
had c
a c
chance c
to c
speak c
with c
them c
. c

From c
that c
, c
I c
learnt c
more c
about c
instruments i
. c

Finally c
, c
the c
date i
of c
concer i
came c
. c

After c
the c
concer i
finished c
successfully c
, c
I c
was c
happier c
than c
ever c
because c
the c
succeed i
inclueded i
my c
work c
and c
that c
was c
the c
most c
enjoyable c
moment c
in c
my c
life c
. c

Anyway c
, c
now c
I c
have c
to c
stop c
to c
finish c
my c
homework c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
receiving c
your c
letter c
again c
. c

Best c
wishes c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show c
named c
OVER c
THE c
RAINBOW c
. c

Regarding i
your c
advertisement c
, c
it c
is c
the i
LONDON c
'S c
NEWEST c
AND c
BEST c
MUSICAL c
SHOW c
, c
but c
I c
was c
deeply c
disappointed c
at i
it c
. c

According c
to c
your c
advertisement c
, c
the c
starrings i
were c
DANNY c
BROOK c
AND c
TINA c
TRUELOVE c
. c

I c
decided c
to c
go c
to c
see c
this c
show c
because c
of c
its c
starrings i
, c
but c
at i
the c
day c
I c
saw c
it c
, c
a c
different c
actor c
played i
. c

He c
was c
not c
DANNY c
BROOK c
. c

Moreover c
there c
was i
no c
discount c
ticket i
. c

They c
were c
all c
sold c
out c
. c

You c
should c
have c
said c
they i
were c
very c
few c
. c

I c
had c
to c
buy c
a c
£ c
20 c
ticket c
. c

To c
make c
matters c
worse c
, c
the c
time i
that c
the c
show c
started c
was c
delayed c
. c

It c
started c
at c
20:15 c
, c
fourty i
five c
minutes c
later i
! c

That c
's c
why c
I c
could c
n't c
have c
a i
dinner c
at c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
after c
the c
show c
. c

It c
had c
already c
closed c
, i
when c
the c
show c
finished c
. c

I c
'd c
like c
to c
ask c
for c
a c
full c
refund c
for c
this c
awful c
night c
. c

Could c
you c
give c
me c
a c
satisfactory c
reply c
as c
soon c
as c
possible c
. i

yours c
faithfully c

Modern c
technology c
has c
changed c
my c
life c
. c

Especially i
, c
a i
computer c
has c
made i
my c
daily c
life c
change c
dramatically c
. c

It c
is c
only c
two c
or c
three c
years c
since c
I c
have i
used c
a c
computer c
at c
home c
, c
but c
now c
I c
wonder c
how c
I c
can i
live c
without c
it i
. c

I c
open c
my c
e i
- c
mail c
box c
every c
night c
. c

When c
I c
find c
a c
new c
message c
, c
I c
'm c
very c
happy c
. c

Before c
using c
e c
- c
mail c
, c
I c
used c
to c
write c
letters c
and c
sometime i
telephon i
. c

However c
I i
've c
found c
e c
- c
mail c
is c
better c
than c
them i
. c

Because c
as c
soon c
as c
I c
send c
my c
message c
, c
they c
can i
receive c
it c
. c

In c
the i
other c
word c
, c
I c
can c
also c
receive c
their c
reply c
soon i
. c

It c
's c
really c
useful c
, i
when c
I c
need c
quick i
reply c
. c

Overmore i
when c
I c
send c
e c
- c
mail c
, c
I c
need i
not c
worry c
about c
the c
time c
. c

I c
can c
send c
them c
anytime c
I c
like c
. c

Thanks c
to c
modern c
technology c
, c
I c
enjoy c
chatting c
with c
my c
friend i
in c
other c
countries c
and c
my c
family c
in c
Japan c
almost c
every c
day c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
show c
, c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
which i
I c
saw c
in c
your c
theatre c
last c
week c
. c

I c
was c
really c
disappointed c
because c
the c
show c
was c
far c
from c
what c
I c
expected c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
was c
really c
expecting c
to c
see c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
my c
favourite c
actor c
. c

However c
, c
he c
was c
not c
on c
the c
stage c
that c
day c
. c

Secondally i
the c
show c
started c
late c
and c
I c
had c
to c
wait c
for c
45 c
minutes c
without i
doing c
anything i
. c

It c
was c
a c
waste c
of c
time c
. c

I c
also c
thought c
that c
there c
should c
have c
been c
discounts c
for c
students c
, c
which c
in c
fact c
was i
not c
available c
and c
I c
had c
to c
pay c
for i
normal i
price c
. c

Furthur i
more c
, c
the c
restaurant c
in c
the c
theatre c
was c
closed c
after c
the c
show c
because c
of c
the c
delay c
. c

I c
had c
to c
go c
home c
without c
eating c
a i
dinner c
, c
though c
I c
was c
really c
hungry c
. c

I c
have c
to c
say c
that c
the c
evening c
was c
terrible c
. c

If c
I c
had c
known c
all i
of c
them c
, c
I c
would c
have c
changed c
my c
plan c
and c
could c
have c
a i
better c
time c
. c

I c
strongly c
suggest c
you c
should i
give c
us c
right i
information c
. c

I c
also i
would c
like c
to c
claim c
some i
refund c
for c
the c
evening c
. c

I c
hope c
this c
matter c
will c
receive c
your c
prompt c
attention c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Fashion c
in c
100 c
years c

If c
you c
compare c
the c
fashion c
now c
with c
that c
of c
100 c
years c
ago c
, c
you c
'll c
notice c
that c
there c
are c
incredably i
big c
difference i
between c
them c
. c

People c
have c
become c
more c
informal c
, c
casual c
and c
practical c
than c
before c
. c

But c
how c
about c
the c
fashion c
of c
the c
future c
, c
for c
example c
, c
100 c
years c
from c
now c
? c

I c
think c
it c
'll c
also c
be c
very c
different c
from c
now c
. c

But c
in c
which i
way c
? c

First c
of c
all c
, c
people c
might c
think c
more c
about c
the c
function c
of c
clothes c
than c
the c
design c
. c

For c
example c
, c
they c
'll c
wear c
a i
cloth i
which c
protect i
themselves i
from c
air c
pollution c
, c
sunshine c
etc c
. c

Imagine c
that c
all c
the c
people c
have c
masks c
on c
their c
mouthes i
and c
noses c
like c
we c
have c
sun c
- c
glasses c
, c
and c
that c
all c
the c
masks c
are c
designers i
brands c
, c
which c
are c
made c
of c
special i
material c
to c
prevent c
us c
from c
breathing c
in c
polluted c
air c
. c

It c
's c
like c
a c
joke c
, c
but c
a c
bit c
scarely i
. c

Imagine c
that c
all c
the c
people c
have c
hats c
with c
big i
edges i
to c
protect c
their c
faces c
from c
sun i
- i
burn c
, c
and c
it c
's c
the c
most i
trendy c
fashion c
of c
the c
year c
! c

It c
's c
funny c
. c

But c
we c
never c
know c
! c
! c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
recently c
had c
a c
holiday c
in c
London c
and c
had i
been c
to c
your c
musical c
show c
' c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
' c
but c
found c
it c
very c
disappointing c
. c

It c
is i
said c
that i
the c
singers c
are c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
in c
the c
advertisement c
. c

However c
, c
there c
was c
a c
different c
unknown i
actor c
in c
that c
. c

The c
show c
started c
later i
at i
20:15 c
which i
was c
very c
different c
in i
' c
19.30 c
' c
as i
shown c
. c

There c
was c
no c
discount c
at c
all c
which i
is i
in c
contrast c
with c
' c
Discounts c
Availabe i
' c
. c

After c
the c
show c
, c
I c
wanted c
to c
have c
something c
in c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
and c
found c
it c
was c
closed c
because i
of c
no c
reason c
. c

The c
real c
show c
on i
it c
owns c
is c
really c
very c
different c
to c
what c
are i
mentioned i
in c
the c
advertisement c
. c

I c
am c
unsatisfied c
and c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
for c
some c
money c
back c
. c

Please c
would c
you c
also c
change c
the c
advertisement c
to i
the c
level c
of c
the c
actual c
facts c
. c

Thank c
you c
for c
your c
attention c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

What c
will c
clothes c
be c
like c
100 c
years c
from c
now c
? c

It c
is c
a c
very c
hard c
thing c
to c
predict c
. c

The c
fashion c
of i
nowaday i
clothings i
is i
just c
keep i
on c
changing c
. c

Although c
some c
may c
appears i
again c
after c
few i
years c
different i
styles c
are c
developed c
. c

For i
the c
fashion c
of c
the c
future c
, c
I c
think c
it c
depends c
on c
the i
people c
's c
own i
personalities c
and c
develope i
their c
own c
styles c
which c
suits i
them c
the c
most c
. c

They c
can c
wear c
different c
kinds c
of c
clothing c
, c
like c
they c
design c
for c
themselves c
or c
those c
like c
history c
can c
wear c
those c
of c
victorian i
time i
and c
in c
different c
countries c
. c

For i
the c
colours c
, c
I c
think c
the i
metalic i
colours c
, c
especially c
silver c
, c
will c
be c
the c
most c
popular c
. c

As c
different c
kinds c
of c
farbics i
will c
be c
invented c
& i
the c
clothings c
will c
never c
be c
just c
cotton c
as c
always c
been c
seen c
. c

Maybe c
paper c
can c
also c
be c
a c
farbic i
use i
for i
make i
clothings i
and c
for c
those c
who c
like c
to c
wear c
new c
clothes c
everyday i
. c

They c
can c
be c
thrown c
away c
after c
wearing c
it i
and c
light i
enough c
to c
be c
carried c
around c
whenever c
you c
want c
to c
change c
your i
wearing c
. c

Dear c
Mrs. c
Ryan c
. i

I c
'm c
glad c
to c
receive c
your c
letter c
. c

I c
'm c
very c
happy c
to c
know c
that c
I c
have c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
. c

It c
will c
be c
great c
to c
spend c
two c
weeks c
at c
Camp c
California c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
say c
that c
the c
only c
month c
available c
from i
me c
to c
travel c
is c
July c
. c

I c
finish c
my c
classes c
on c
the c
25th c
of c
June c
and c
August c
is c
for i
going c
with c
my c
parents c
to c
France c
. c

This c
has i
been c
scheduled c
3 c
months c
ago c
. c

About c
accommodation c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
the c
log c
cabins c
because c
I c
think c
they c
are c
more i
cleaner c
than c
the c
tents c
. c

While c
I c
'm c
stayin i
there c
I c
would c
like c
to c
practise c
tennis c
and c
basketball c
, c
as c
I c
have c
been c
playing c
both c
sports c
all c
my c
life c
, c
and c
I c
have c
to c
say c
that c
I c
am c
very c
good c
at c
both c
. c

There c
is c
one c
question c
I c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
you c
about c
the c
Camp c
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
if c
there c
are c
any c
washing c
machines c
or c
a c
place c
to c
wash c
our c
clothes c
. c

I c
hope c
this c
letter c
contains c
all c
the c
information c
you c
need c
from c
me c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

From c
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
the c
real c
question c
is c
: c
Who c
said c
that c
is c
enjoyable c
? c

Maybe c
for c
women c
, c
but c
not c
for c
me c
. c

I c
know c
that c
this c
sounds c
horrible c
, c
but c
sometimes c
it c
's c
what c
really c
happens c
. c

For c
men c
, c
sometimes c
is i
hard c
to c
go c
shopping c
with c
their c
partners c
. c

Sometimes c
that c
means c
a c
complete c
tour c
around c
all c
the c
fashion c
shops c
in c
town c
. c

And c
of c
course c
, c
we c
are c
not c
allowed c
to c
stop c
in c
a c
place c
that c
we c
like c
. c

The c
Sports i
Shop c
. c

You c
can c
not c
lose i
the i
time c
because c
all c
the c
other c
shops c
could c
be c
closed c
when c
you c
arrive c
. c

And c
that c
is c
allways i
what c
we c
want c
. c

That c
's c
men c
's c
intention c
. c

Another c
point c
is c
to c
go c
a i
big c
area c
. c

Specially c
week i
- c
ends c
. c

Everyone c
pushing c
a c
trolley c
and c
crashing c
around c
. c

People c
should c
have c
to c
take i
a c
license i
to c
drive c
those c
things c
. c

Someone c
could c
be c
injured c
. c

And c
of c
course c
, c
the c
time c
to c
pay c
. c

A c
huge c
que i
that c
lasts c
half c
an c
hour c
or c
more c
and c
finishes c
with c
you c
completely c
freaked c
out c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
for c
me c
to i
go c
shopping c
is c
not c
enjoyable c
at c
all c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
you c
inform c
you c
about c
the c
dissapointing i
evening c
I c
had c
when c
I c
went c
to c
your c
theather i
to c
see c
the c
play c
called c
" c
OVER c
THE c
RAINBOW c
" c
. c

According c
to c
the c
advertisement c
you c
gave i
, c
there c
have i
been c
some c
important c
differents i
. i

Firstly c
, c
the c
play c
started c
almost c
an c
hour c
late c
, c
and c
I c
went c
there c
to c
see c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
but c
there c
was c
a c
different c
actor c
on c
stage c
. c

Secondly c
, c
in c
the c
advertisement c
the i
discounts c
are i
available c
but c
in i
the c
tickets c
I c
bought c
they c
were c
no c
discount c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
I c
had c
planned c
to c
have c
a c
great c
dinner c
with c
my c
family c
in c
your c
restaurant c
and c
it c
was c
closed c
because c
the c
people c
who c
work c
in i
were c
on c
holidays i
. c

In c
addition c
to c
this c
, c
I c
have c
to c
tell c
you c
that c
it c
was c
the c
most c
horrible c
evening c
I c
had i
out i
and c
because c
of c
this c
I c
want c
to c
ask c
you c
if c
you c
could c
send c
me c
a c
refound i
of i
a i
part c
of c
the c
money c
I c
wasted c
there c
. c

I c
would c
be c
grateful c
if c
you c
do i
it i
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
want c
to c
tell c
you c
that c
it c
is c
not c
useful c
for c
you c
and c
your c
theather i
to c
cheat c
to i
your c
customers c
. c
If c
you c
do c
it i
, c
there c
will c
be c
no c
bussiness i
for c
you c
and c
no c
satisfaction c
for c
them c
. c

I c
look c
fordwad i
to c
hearing c
from c
you c

Your i
sincerely c
, c

How c
has c
modern c
technology c
change i
my c
daily c
life c
? c

Nowadays c
, c
technology c
is c
the c
most c
useful c
tool c
that c
human c
beings c
have c
. c

It c
affects c
everyone c
who c
live i
in i
this c
planet c
and c
every c
activity c
made i
in i
it c
. c

In c
this c
case i
we c
are c
going c
to c
focus c
on c
me c
. i

Emilio c
Almodar c
, c
18 c
years c
old c
, c
University c
Student c
, c
and c
the c
career c
I c
have c
choosen i
is c
Internacional i
Commerce c
or c
Market i
. c

I c
use c
technology c
every c
moment i
but c
I c
did c
not c
realise c
. c

For c
example c
, c
when c
I c
come c
back c
home c
from c
university c
and c
I c
call c
my c
friends c
, c
I c
am c
using c
it c
because c
at c
home c
we c
have c
very c
modern c
phones c
and c
fax i
and i
almost c
everybody c
in c
my c
family c
has c
a c
cellular c
phone c
and c
thing i
like c
that c
. c

We c
also c
have c
five c
computer i
, c
the c
latest c
versions i
of c
them c
, c
because c
they c
are c
useful c
for c
my c
father c
to c
work c
and i
for c
me c
to c
do c
some c
special c
works i
for c
University c
. c

This i
machines c
are c
connected c
to c
Internet i
, c
and c
it i
gives c
to i
my c
family c
too c
much c
facility i
to i
get c
every i
information i
we c
want c
, c
from c
how c
to c
prepare c
son i
drink c
to c
what c
was c
the c
result c
of c
the i
Sunday c
's c
football c
match c
. c

In c
addition c
to c
this c
we c
use c
the c
net c
to c
comunicate i
with c
some c
friends c
we c
have c
in c
U.S.A. i
It c
's c
really c
amazing c
. c

Apart c
from c
this c
, c
I c
do c
n't c
spent c
my c
free c
time c
in i
technology c
. c

I c
prefer c
playing c
rugby c
and c
going c
out c
with c
friends c
, c
because c
technology c
is c
not c
all c
life i
, c
but c
it c
is c
only c
a c
little c
part c
of c
it c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
: c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
ask c
about c
your c
advertisement c
and c
theatre c
show c
. c

I c
am c
a c
student c
in c
Liverpool c
, c
and c
recently c
I c
had c
a c
week c
's c
holiday c
in c
London c
. c

First i
day c
in c
London c
, c
I c
saw c
your c
advertisement c
which c
was c
very c
interesting c
to c
me c
. c

But c
I c
was c
really c
disappointed c
it i
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
there c
was c
only c
one c
actor c
that c
was c
different c
from c
your c
advertisement c
. c

Also c
, c
it c
was c
certain c
to i
me c
to i
bought i
a c
discount c
tickets i
cause i
I c
am c
a c
student c
. c

But c
, c
it c
was c
not c
availiable i
. c

Second c
, c
I c
went c
to c
the c
theatre c
exactly i
seven c
thirty c
in c
the c
evening c
. c

However c
the i
show c
started c
45 c
minutes c
later c
. c

I c
wasted c
time i
too c
much c
for i
waiting c
. c

It c
was c
not c
good c
to i
me c
, c
cause i
I c
had c
only c
one c
week i
holiday c
in c
London c
. c

Moreover c
the i
theatre c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
with c
the c
word c
" c
Stuff i
vacation c
" c
on c
the c
front c
door c
after c
the c
show c
. c

It c
was c
absolutely i
different c
from c
your c
leaflet c
. c

On c
the c
whole c
, c
I c
was c
really c
disappointed c
at c
that c
time c
. c

Could c
you c
do i
me c
my i
half c
of c
money c
back c
. i

I c
enclose c
my c
phone c
number c
and c
address c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c

Lo c
Son c
Lin c
. c

Fashion c
of c
the c
Future c
. c

Have c
you c
ever c
seen c
the c
film c
star c
wars c
? c

And c
did c
you c
notice c
something c
about c
fashion c
of c
the c
future c
? c

I c
think c
the c
people c
will c
wear c
convenient c
clothes c
with c
simple i
design c
in c
the c
future c
. c

Because c
the c
people c
will c
stay c
at c
home c
more c
than c
now c
with c
their c
computer c
. c

And c
they c
will c
use c
soft c
cozy c
cloths i
like c
cotton c
and c
silk c
. c

However c
, c
if c
they c
have c
some c
special c
day c
when i
like c
important i
public c
day c
or c
special c
day c
of c
their c
life c
, c
they c
will c
wear c
very c
different c
kinds c
of c
clothes c
which c
was i
you c
never i
seen c
before c
. c

Some c
of c
that c
will c
be c
very c
strange c
to c
our c
eyes c
, c
but c
some c
of c
others i
will c
be c
familiar c
to c
us c
. c

And c
they c
will c
use c
the i
most c
kinds c
of c
things c
like i
small c
stone c
to c
diamond c
etc c
. c

Maybe c
some c
peoples i
are i
nakid i
. c

It c
will c
be c
very c
interesting c
... c

Just c
imagine c
the c
way i
of c
future c
people c
's c
life c
. c

And c
you c
can c
see c
the i
their c
clothes c
also c
. c

13th c
June c
2000 c

Dear c
Mrs c
Ryan c
, c

Thank c
you c
very c
much c
for c
your c
letter c
. c

I c
was c
really c
surprised c
and c
very c
happy c
when c
I c
read c
that c
I c
have c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
. c

First c
of c
all c
because c
I c
have c
never c
been c
to c
California c
and c
second c
because c
it c
's c
the c
first c
time c
I c
have c
ever c
won c
something c
. c

The c
only c
time c
that c
is i
possible c
for c
me c
to c
travel c
is c
July c
, c
because c
I c
am c
working c
for c
a c
bank c
and c
this c
is c
the c
only c
month c
I c
can c
go c
on c
holiday c
. c

For c
my c
stay c
in c
California c
I c
would c
prefer c
the i
accommodation c
in c
tents c
because c
this c
gives c
me c
a c
feeling c
of c
freedom c
and c
adventure c
and c
it c
is c
quite c
different c
to c
my c
live i
here c
in c
Greece c
. c

The c
activities c
I c
would c
like c
mot i
to c
do c
are c
climbing c
and c
surfing c
. c

In c
my c
free c
time c
I c
have c
climbed c
a c
lot c
of c
mountains c
in c
the c
surrounding c
area c
so c
I c
can c
say c
, i
that c
I c
am c
quite c
good c
in i
climbing c
. c

But c
I c
have c
never c
' c
surfed c
' c
in c
my c
live i
, c
so c
that c
is c
an c
activity c
I c
have c
to c
learn i
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
there c
are c
some c
things c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
: c
What c
kind c
of c
wheather i
do c
you c
have c
in c
California c
? c

Is c
it c
very c
hot c
? c

What c
kind c
of c
clothes c
should c
I c
bring c
with c
me c
? c

And c
what c
about c
money c
? c

How c
much c
money c
Should i
I c
take c
with c
me c
? c

Are c
there c
any c
activities c
which c
are c
not c
included c
? c

And c
my c
last c
question c
: c
how c
many c
persons i
are c
going c
to c
stay c
in c
each c
tent c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c

Many c
people c
, c
especially c
women c
, c
love c
shopping c
. c

If c
you c
go c
to c
the c
centre c
of c
every i
big c
town c
you c
will c
see c
people c
walking c
from c
store c
to c
store c
searching c
for c
something c
to c
wear c
or c
to c
buy c
to c
eat c
. c

But c
shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c
. c

First c
of c
all c
because c
of c
the c
big i
variety c
in c
the c
store c
. c

Very c
often c
you c
do c
n't c
know c
what c
to c
buy c
because c
we c
do c
n't c
have c
only c
three c
or c
four c
different c
sport i
shoes c
to c
choose c
from c
, c
not i
, c
we c
have c
to c
choose c
out c
of c
twenty c
or c
thirty c
such c
as c
Nike c
, c
adidas i
or c
Fila c
. c

And c
very c
often c
you c
have c
to c
pay c
a c
lot c
of c
money c
for c
the c
product c
you c
want c
. c

Another c
cause i
is c
that c
shops c
and c
stores c
are c
often c
overcrowded c
. c

Very c
often c
you c
can c
hardly c
move c
because c
of c
the c
crowds c
of c
people c
. c

And c
many c
people c
are c
in c
a c
hurry c
, c
so c
do c
n't c
wonder i
if c
other c
people c
have i
not c
tolerance i
and c
patience c
to c
wait c
and c
hit c
you c
with c
their c
shopping c
cars i
. c

Of c
course c
there c
are c
a c
lot c
of c
other c
causes i
why c
shopping c
is c
n't c
always c
great c
fun c
, c
but c
the c
last c
cause i
, c
which c
is c
very c
important c
for c
me c
is i
that c
shopping c
is c
becoming c
more c
and c
more c
impersonal c
. c

That c
means c
that c
there c
are c
more c
and c
more c
big c
supermarkets c
and c
big c
stores c
, c
where c
noone i
has c
time c
for c
you c
to c
show i
you c
or c
explain c
things c
to c
you c
such c
as c
what c
kind c
of c
bicycle c
is c
the c
best c
for c
me i
, c
no c
one c
to c
talk c
to c
and c
noone i
to c
complaine i
. i

That c
is c
the c
most c
important c
reason c
why c
I c
only c
like c
to c
go c
shopping c
in c
little i
stores c
, c
where c
I c
have c
peace c
and c
quiet c
and c
very c
often c
nothing c
to c
complaine i
about c
. c

Dear c
Mrs c

in c
the c
USA c
. c

About c
the c
information c
that c
you c
need c
, c
I c

tell c

I c
ca c
n't c

more c
than c
one c
month c
holidays i
each c
year c
and c
on i
the c
other c
months c
I c
will c
be c
very c
busy c
becase i
my c
workmates c

these c
months c
. c

With i
the c
accomodation i
, c
I c
would c

is c
more c
according i
with i
a c
camp c
. c

And c
with i
the c
activities c
I i
must c
chose i
Photography c
and c
Painting c
becase i
I c
am c
not c
very c
good c
for i
sports c
and c

Dear c
Kim c
, c

Here c
I c
am c
, c
writting i
you i
to c
tell c
everything i
about c
my c
wonderful c
experience c
at c
the c
concert c
. c

You c
ca c
n't c
imagine c
How i
much c
did i
I c
enjoy i
that c
journey i
. c

I c
started c
early c
in c
the c
morning c
helping i
to c
carry c
the i
stuff c
from c
the c
trucks c
to c
the c
place c
where c
the c
band c
played c
, i
I c
help i
with c
the c
music i
stuff c
like c
speakers c
, c
mics c
, c
lights c
, c
sound c
, i
etc c
. c

And c
later c
the c
band c
arrived c
and c
played c
two c
or c
three c
times c
before c
the c
concert c
started c
. c

And c
I c
was i
helping c
them c
fixing i
the c
last c
details c
. c

When c
the c
concert c
started c
I i
was c
preparing c
some c
drinks c
for c
the c
band c
because c
when i
the c
concert c
finished c
they c
were i
very c
tired c
and c
tersty i
. c

After c
the c
concert c
I c
only c
help i
with i
tidy c
up c
the c
place c
and c
made c
sure c
that c
everything c
was c
under c
control c
and c
clean c
. c

Later c
the c
band c
was c
talking c
to c
me c
, c
I c
could c
get c
their c
new c
album c
free c
, c
and c
some c
other c
souvenirs c
from c
the c
band c
. c

But c
the c
thing c
that c
particulary i
liked c
me c
was c
that c
I c
could c
do c
all c
kind i
of c
things c
just c
in c
one c
day c
and c
I c
could c
feel c
different c
emotions c
. c

So c
, c
that c
's c
everything c
that c
I c
can c
tell c
you c
, i
I c
enjoy i
a i
lot c
and c
I c
hope c
to c
have c
another c
experience c
like c
this c
. c

Thank c
you c
for c
the c
letter c
you c
have c
sent c
recently c
. c

It c
was c
a c
surprise c
to c
know i
that c
I c
won c
the c
first c
prize c
. c

The c
reasons i
I c
am c
really c
writing c
, c
However i
, c
is c
to c
give c
you c
some c
details c
of i
my c
trip c
to c
California c
. c

I c
'll c
be c
taking c
an c
English c
Examination c
at c
the c
end c
of c
June c
and c
I c
think c
it c
would c
be c
a c
good c
idea c
if c
I c
can c
travel c
in c
July c
because c
it c
's c
the c
only c
month c
I c
can c
spend c
abroad c
this c
year c
. c

In c
the c
letter c
you c
said c
that c
accommodation i
provided c
can c
be c
either c
tents i
or c
log i
cabins i
. c

I c
would c
prefer c
to c
stay c
in c
tents i
so c
that c
I c
will c
have c
the c
chance c
to c
be c
in c
contact c
with c
the i
nature c
as c
well c
as c
the c
scenery c
around c
. i

Another i
thing c
I c
would c
like c
to c
choose c
from c
the c
activity c
list c
is i
singing c
( c
because c
I c
take i
part c
in c
a c
chorus i
at c
school c
) c
and c
photography c
. c

I c
'm c
really c
good c
taking i
pictures c
, i
it c
's c
a c
way c
I c
have c
to c
express c
my c
feelings c
. c

I c
wonder c
if c
you c
could c
send c
me c
more c
information c
about c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
have i
we c
bring i
. c

Do c
you c
think c
you c
could c
also c
let c
me c
know c
how c
much c
money c
we c
will c
need c
during c
our c
stay c
at c
the c
Camp c
. c

I c
would c
be c
grateful c
if c
you c
could c
send c
me c
a c
brochure c
and c
a c
map c
showing c
where c
the c
camp c
is c
. c

thanking c
you c
in c
anticipation c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

What c
a c
surprise c
it c
was c
to c
get c
letter i
from c
you c
after c
all c
this c
time c
. c

Sorry c
I c
haven't c
written c
for c
so c
long c
but c
I c
was c
really c
busy c
trying c
to c
apply c
for c
a c
job c
. c

This c
is c
just c
to c
let c
you c
know c
with c
whom c
I c
worked c
. c

In c
order c
to c
celebrate c
the c
125 i
aniversary i
of c
the c
city c
, c
the c
Coun i
Council c
organised c
an c
open c
air c
concert c
. c

It c
was c
a c
summer c
night c
and c
all c
the c
citizens c
, c
as c
well c
as c
tourists c
, c
had c
the c
opportunity c
to c
attend c
. c

The c
pop c
band c
" c
Five c
" c
arrived c
into i
town c
and c
needed c
people c
to c
help c
with c
not c
only c
the c
organisation c
but c
also c
the i
stages c
and c
sound i
. c

I c
knew c
some c
help c
was c
needed c
so c
I c
decided c
to c
speak c
to c
the c
manager c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
believe c
when i
he c
said c
: c
" c
O.K. c
if i
you c
want c
to c
help c
, c
here c
is c
a c
list c
of c
what c
you c
can c
do c
. c
" c

My c
job c
was c
to c
leave c
some c
leaflets c
on i
shops c
, c
restaurants c
and c
streets i
. c

Working c
with c
this c
band c
was c
an c
experience c
I c
will c
never c
forget c
. c

What c
I c
really c
enjoyed c
was c
been i
part c
of c
the c
staff c
. c

Although c
I c
was c
too i
nervious i
, c
I c
knew c
I c
could c
do c
the c
job c
well c
. c

I c
'd c
love c
to c
hear c
all c
your c
news c
, i
why c
do c
n't c
you c
come c
and c
visit c
me c
? c

Perhaps c
I c
could c
show c
you c
the c
pictures c
I c
took c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
soon c
. c

Love c
from c
, c

Dear c
Mr i
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
express c
my c
dissapointment i
about i
the c
play c
" c
over c
the c
rainbow c
" c
which i
is c
performing i
at c
Circle i
Theatre c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
the c
advertisement c
for c
the c
show c
announced c
Mr. c
Danny c
Brook c
as c
the c
principal c
actor c
. c

Surprisingly c
, c
he c
never c
appeared c
on c
the c
stage c
, i
during c
the c
play c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the c
theatre c
or c
the c
company c
is c
lying c
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
show c
started c
one c
hour c
fifteen i
past i
after c
. c

We c
arrived c
at c
the c
theatre c
in i
time c
and c
we c
had c
to c
wait c
all c
that c
time c
until c
the c
show c
began c
. c

Finally c
, c
when c
I c
asked c
about c
the c
discounts c
, c
an c
agressive i
employee c
refused c
to c
answer c
me c
. c

He c
stayed c
looking c
at c
me c
and c
laughing c
. c

It c
was c
incredible c
. c

The c
evening c
was c
a c
horrible c
surprise c
, c
completely c
different c
from c
the i
promise c
written c
in c
the c
advertisement c
. c

Defineteley i
, c
I c
want c
my c
money c
back c
as c
soon c
as c
possible c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c

Yours c
faithfully c

" c
Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

" c
I c
knew c
that c
but c
I c
would c
prefer c
to c
trust c
her c
so c
I c
told c
everything i
about c
Lynne c
Harter c
, c
our c
new c
collegue i
at c
school c
. c

However c
, c
I c
have c
to c
admit c
that c
I c
told c
her c
my c
own c
opinion c
. c

Well c
, c
it i
was c
the c
beginning c
of c
my c
tragedy c
. c

So c
, c
I c
told c
Pat c
that c
Lynne c
was c
ugly c
, c
fat c
like c
a c
cow c
, c
and c
extremely c
agressive i
. c

But c
I c
could c
n't c
shut c
my c
mouth c
, i
I c
continued c
: c
" c
You c
ca c
n't c
believe c
it c
Pat i
, c
she c
wears c
trousers c
like c
men i
and c
green c
flowery c
blouses c
" i
Of c
course c
, c
my c
friend c
and c
I c
were c
laughing c
during i
half c
an c
hour c
. c

Two c
days c
after i
, c
when c
Pat c
came c
back c
to c
my c
school c
and i
she c
met c
Mr c
Harter c
, c
our c
head c
teacher c
, c
she c
told c
everything i
about c
Ann1 c
. c

In i
that c
precisely c
moment c
I c
realized c
that c
I c
had c
forgotten c
to c
tell c
her c
that c
Ann c
was c
Mr c
Harter c
's c
niece c
. c

I c
know c
it c
's c
my c
fault c
. c

But c
, c
well c
, c
unhappiness i
started c
with c
Pat c
and c
my c
reveilled i
secrets c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
complain c
for i
the c
musical c
show c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
. c

I c
've i
been c
recently c
seeing c
in i
your c
theatre c
during c
my c
week c
's c
holiday c
in c
London c
I i
must c
say c
I c
had c
a c
very c
disappointing c
evening c
! c
I c
was c
sure c
this c
was c
the i
London c
's c
newest c
and c
best c
musical c
show c
I i
had i
ever c
seen c
because i
of c
the c
good c
publicity c
you c
made i
in i
your c
advertisement c
, c
but c
I c
thought c
completely c
wrong c
! c

Firstly c
, c
the c
play c
started c
nearly c
an c
hour c
later c
as i
I c
expected c
! c

If c
the c
spectacle i
has i
been c
beautiful c
, c
I c
would c
have c
been c
quite c
pleased i
to c
wait c
. c

Then c
, c
I c
had c
read c
that c
there c
would c
have i
been c
discounts c
available c
, c
but c
it i
was c
n't c
true c
! c

So i
it c
's c
better c
not c
to c
write c
anything c
if c
you i
do c
n't c
make c
it c
true i
then i
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
hoped c
that c
, c
after c
these c
incidents c
, c
I c
would c
enjoy c
myself c
, c
but c
there c
was c
another c
change c
of i
programme i
: c
starring i
! c

The c
main c
actor c
, c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
was c
changed c
and c
the c
one c
who c
played c
his c
part c
was c
n't c
as c
good c
as c
I c
expected c
. c

Finished i
the c
show c
, c
I c
went c
to c
your c
theatre c
restaurant c
, c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
and c
this c
hasn't i
been c
said c
before c
. c

Moreover c
, c
I c
was c
shocked c
by c
the c
reason c
for c
which c
it c
was i
closed c
: c
the c
chef c
went i
away c
after c
he c
received c
a c
phone c
call c
! c

For c
all c
these c
reason i
, c
I c
want c
to c
ask c
for c
my c
money c
back c
and c
I c
hope c
to c
hear c
from c
you c
soon c
! c

A c
suggestion c
? c

Organize i
better i
your c
shows c
and c
do c
not c
exagerate i
with c
publicity c
! c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

There c
would i
be c
many c
things c
to c
say c
about c
. i

Technology c
is c
a c
wide c
field c
which c
increases i
very c
quickly c
. c

It c
's c
creating c
an c
artificial c
world c
, c
where c
everything c
is c
electronic c
and c
fast c
. c

I c
'm c
not c
sure c
if c
I c
must i
say c
technology i
has c
changed c
our c
life c
in c
positive i
or i
not c
. c

Certainly c
, c
thanks c
to c
it c
, c
we c
can c
do c
things c
today c
that c
were c
impossible c
a c
few c
centuries c
ago c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
we c
make i
a c
phone c
call c
with c
an c
astonish i
rapidity c
, c
instead i
at i
my c
grandparents c
' c
time c
it c
took c
one c
month c
or c
more c
to c
have i
contact i
with c
people c
abroad c
, c
because c
the c
only c
means c
of c
communication c
was c
the c
post c
and c
its c
service c
was c
very c
slow c
! c

When c
appeared i
the c
first c
car c
, c
it c
was c
already c
a c
great c
success c
. c

Before c
that c
, c
people c
travelled c
by c
horse c
or c
worse c
. c

Fortunately c
today c
everyone c
can c
take c
an c
aeroplane c
and c
go c
to c
America c
, c
Australia c
or c
wherever c
else c
he i
wants i
! c

What c
can c
I c
say c
about c
the i
television c
? c

It c
allows c
us c
to c
keep i
connections c
with c
the c
other c
states c
of c
the c
world c
, c
improves c
our c
knowledge c
, c
offers c
us c
news c
, c
advises c
us c
about c
events c
which c
happened i
or c
will c
happen c
. c

In c
the i
not c
very c
far i
1914 i
, c
parent i
sent c
their c
sons c
in i
war c
and c
it c
was c
very c
difficult c
to c
know c
if c
they c
were c
still c
alive c
or c
dead c
! c

It c
's c
terrible c
! c

Despite c
this c
, c
I c
'm c
convinced c
all c
this c
progress c
caused i
some c
damages i
at i
the c
community c
, c
not c
only c
phisically i
. c

We c
pay c
less c
attention c
to c
our c
life c
, c
to c
those c
things c
which c
give c
us c
happiness c
, c
that c
are c
n't c
money c
, c
success c
, c
power c
. c

We c
became i
passive c
people c
, c
we c
follow c
the c
same c
routine c
every c
day c
and c
we c
live c
in c
a c
society c
where c
rules c
are c
strongly c
fixed c
. c

I c
think c
everyone c
should c
live c
his c
own c
life c
how c
he c
wants c
to c
live c
it c
and c
make c
him i
known c
for c
who c
he c
is c
, c
not c
for c
his c
money c
, c
but c
for c
his c
abilities c
, c
his c
good c
habits c
, c
his c
personality c
. c

Finally c
, c
everyone c
should c
decrease i
his c
own c
life c
's c
rythm i
. c

Mr c
John c
Smythe c
, c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
tell c
you c
about c
the c
horrible c
evening c
I c
had c
on c
Friday c
. c

I c
was c
very c
excited c
with i
the c
idea c
of c
going c
to c
the c
theatre c
, c
but c
it c
did c
n't c
work c
out c
as c
I c
thought c
it c
will i
. c

First c
of c
all c
the i
starring c
actors c
were c
supposed c
to c
be c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
, i
Tina c
did c
act c
, c
but c
Danny c
Brook c
was c
replaced c
by c
an c
awful c
actor c
whose c
name c
I c
do c
n't c
recall c
. c

Second c
of c
all c
, c
the c
play c
was c
suposed i
to c
start c
at c
19:30 c
, c
but c
it c
started c
at c
20:15 c
. c

I c
'm c
not c
used c
to c
waste i
my c
time c
sitting c
on c
a c
chair c
waiting c
, c
I c
do c
have c
better c
things c
to c
do c
with c
it c
. c

Another c
thing c
I c
want c
to c
complain c
about c
, i
is c
that c
your i
advertised c
that c
discounts c
were c
available c
, c
but c
there c
was c
n't c
any c
discount c
at c
all c
. c

To c
finish c
my c
" c
marvelous i
" c
evening c
, c
I c
wanted c
to c
eat c
at c
your c
restaurant c
, c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
and c
no c
reason c
was c
given c
. c

As c
I c
did c
n't c
have c
a c
" c
perfect c
evening c
out c
" c
, c
I c
think c
I c
have c
the c
right c
to c
ask c
for c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
hope c
you c
understand c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c

Pat c
's c
story c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Now c
you c
've i
probably c
asking c
yourself c
what c
does c
it i
mean c
, c
well c
, c
now c
I c
'm c
going c
to c
explain c
it c
to c
you c
. c

Two c
years c
ago c
in c
this c
school c
, c
Pat c
and c
I c
used c
to c
be c
best c
friends c
. c

We c
used c
to c
tell c
everything c
to c
each c
other c
. c

I c
was c
having c
some c
family c
problems c
, c
so c
my c
marks c
were c
getting i
down c
and c
down c
. c

Pat c
was c
worried c
, c
she c
did c
n't c
know c
what c
to c
do c
. c

One c
day c
she c
looked c
me c
in c
the c
eyes c
with c
a c
sharp c
deep i
look c
, c
Never i
have c
I c
seen c
such c
a c
deep c
look c
: i
and c
asked c
me c
what c
was c
happening c
and c
I c
told c
her c
as c
I c
always c
used c
to c
. c

That c
afternoon c
she c
visited c
me c
and c
told c
me c
a c
plan c
she c
had c
designed c
to c
make c
my c
marks c
rise c
. c

It c
consisted c
in c
stealing c
the c
school c
list i
from c
the c
computer c
, c
in c
other c
words c
, c
hack i
the i
school c
software c
. c

I c
thought c
it c
was c
a c
great c
idea c
, c
so c
I c
stole c
about c
ten c
tests c
we c
were c
planned i
to c
do c
. c

Pat c
could c
n't c
stand c
the c
pressure c
of c
the c
" c
crime c
" c
so c
she c
told c
the c
school c
directors c
that c
I c
stole c
the c
tests c
. c

I c
was c
punished c
, c
nearly c
expelt i
, c
but c
Pat c
did c
n't c
receive c
any c
punishment c
. c

I c
never c
accused c
her c
of c
lying c
, c
and c
I i
you c
ask c
me c
why c
, c
I c
really c
do c
n't c
know c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
you c
after c
visiting c
your c
theatre c
. c

Frankly c
speaking c
, c
I c
was c
very c
disappointed c
after c
my c
visit c
. c

I c
was c
displeased c
from c
the c
very c
beginning c
, c
because c
I c
expected c
to c
get c
a c
discount c
as c
I c
'm c
a c
student c
. c

According c
to c
your c
advertisment i
I c
could c
have c
one c
but c
in c
reality c
there c
were c
no c
discounts c
at c
all c
. c

But c
nevertheless c
I c
decided c
to c
go c
to c
your c
show c
. c

The c
show c
started c
t i
20.15 c
instead c
of c
19.30 c
. c

I c
had c
to c
wait c
in c
overcrowded i
hall c
. c

When c
finally i
the c
show c
had i
started c
I c
found c
out c
that c
Danny c
Brook c
was i
replaced c
by c
another c
actor c
. c

One c
of c
the c
reasons c
for c
my c
visiting c
your c
show c
was c
Danny c
Brook c
's c
participance i
. c

So c
, c
you c
could c
understand c
how c
disappointed c
I c
was c
. c

To c
make c
matters c
worse c
the i
restaurant c
which c
was c
mentioned c
in c
your c
advertisment i
was c
closed c
. c

So c
I c
had i
n't c
such c
perfect i
evening c
, i
as c
was c
promised c
in c
your c
advertisment i
. c

In c
fact c
there c
were c
a c
lot c
of c
mistakes c
in c
your c
advertisment i
and c
I c
would c
be c
gratefull i
if c
you c
could c
give c
me c
back c
a c
part c
of c
my c
money c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

How c
has c
modern c
technology c
changed c
your c
daily c
life c
? c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
modern c
technologies c
play c
the i
important c
role c
in c
people c
's c
life i
. c

I c
think c
that c
at c
present c
the c
most c
important c
technologies c
are c
computer c
and c
Internet i
technologies c
. c

Both c
computer i
and c
Internet i
influence c
people c
's c
life i
. c

I c
have c
to c
use c
computer i
every c
day c
. c

It c
helps c
me c
in i
preparing c
my c
homeworks i
. c

Firs i
of c
all c
Internet i
gives c
you c
an i
access c
to c
a c
great c
number c
of c
different c
information i
. c

On c
the c
one c
hand c
Internet i
is c
often c
used c
for c
entertaiment i
, c
but c
on c
the c
other c
hand c
it c
's c
also c
used c
in c
different c
business c
and c
education c
process i
! i

With c
the c
help c
of c
Internet i
technologies c
I c
communicate c
with c
other c
people c
from c
all c
over c
the c
world c
it c
gives c
me c
chance i
to c
improve c
my c
English c
. c

From i
my c
point c
of c
view c
, c
Internet i
can c
be c
used c
in c
education c
, c
because c
it c
gives c
an c
opportunity c
to c
have c
distant i
relations i
between c
pupils c
and c
teachers c
. c

Though c
Internet i
has c
a c
lot c
of c
positive c
aspects c
I i
think c
you c
should c
be c
careful c
with c
it c
and c
not c
to i
be c
depended i
on c
it c
. c

Dear c
Sir c

At c
the c
begining i
I c
would c
like c
to c
thank c
You c
for c
Your c
letter c
- c
it c
pleased c
me c
much c
. c

I c
have c
always c
dreamt c
about c
holidays c
' c
in c
Camp c
California c
' c

However c
there c
are c
some c
problems c
that c
I c
hope c
to c
solve c
. c

First c
of c
all c
the c
only c
suitable c
time c
for c
me c
to c
go c
is c
July c
. c

It c
is c
the c
only c
time c
when c
I c
am c
free c
from c
my c
duties c
- c
I c
am c
a c
doctor c
so c
you c
see c
that c
I c
can c
not c
let c
my c
patients c
down c
. c

If c
we c
are c
talking c
about c
accomodation i
then c
accomodation i
in c
tents c
would c
be c
great c
- c
I c
love c
being c
close c
to c
the i
nature c
. c

I c
would c
like i
You c
to c
know c
also c
about c
my c
two c
hobbys i
: c
swimming c
and c
surfing c
. c

I c
am c
not c
telling i
about c
some c
kind c
of c
achivements i
in c
those c
discipines i
but c
It i
is i
my c
big c
pasion i

I c
hope c
to c
have c
a c
chance c
to c
practice i
both c
of c
theme i
at c
' c
Camp c
California c
' c
. c

There c
is c
also c
one c
thing c
that c
I c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
You i
about c
. c

The c
question c
is c
: c
Do c
I c
need c
some c
extra c
money c
and c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
should c
I c
take c
for c
this c
trip c
? c

Yours c
sincerely c

Anna c
Nowak c

Unconected i
part c
of c
every i
people c
lifes i
is c
shopping c
. c

We c
buy c
everything c
from c
clothes c
to c
food c
and c
the c
only c
thing c
that c
could c
stop c
us c
from c
this c
are i
money c
. c

As c
a c
teenager c
I c
must c
addmit i
that c
there c
is c
nothing c
more c
enjoyable c
from i
shopping c
. c

It c
's c
like c
, c
, c
walking c
in c
the c
clouds c
, c
, c
you c
feel c
like c
flaing i
. c

Choosing c
gave i
me c
such c
big i
pleasure c
because c
I c
never c
have c
to c
worry c
from i
vere i
do i
I c
take i
money c
for c
my c
wishes c
. c

It c
all c
comes c
from c
my c
parents c
. c

All c
I c
ought i
to c
do c
is c
buy c
and c
choose c
. c

I c
think c
that c
, c
, c
having c
is c
a c
dream c
'' c
of i
all c
of c
us c
. c

It c
's c
hard c
for c
me c
even c
to c
emagine i
the i
situation c
when c
shopping c
is c
not c
enjoyable c
. c

Probably c
it c
is c
one c
of c
the c
moments c
when c
you c
want c
something c
baddly i
and c
you c
ca c
n't c
have c
it c
. c

Another c
situation c
is c
when c
you c
have c
to c
buy c
somebody c
a c
present c
. c

Everybody c
know i
that c
