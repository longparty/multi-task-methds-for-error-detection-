Keeping c
the c
Secret c
of c
Genetic c
Testing c

What c
is c
genetic c
risk c
? c

Genetic c
risk c
refers c
more i
to c
your c
chance c
of c
inheriting c
a c
disorder c
or c
disease c
. c

People c
get c
certain c
disease i
because c
of c
genetic c
changes c
. c

How c
much c
a c
genetic c
change c
tells c
us c
about c
your c
chance c
of c
developing c
a c
disorder c
is c
not c
always c
clear c
. c

If c
your c
genetic c
results c
indicate c
that c
you c
have c
gene c
changes c
associated c
with c
an c
increased c
risk c
of c
heart c
disease c
, c
it c
does c
not c
mean c
that c
you c
definitely c
will c
develop c
heart c
disease c
. c

The c
opposite c
is c
also c
true c
. c

If c
your c
genetic c
results c
show c
that c
you c
do c
not c
have c
changes c
associated c
with c
an c
increased c
risk c
of c
heart c
disease c
, c
it c
is c
still c
possible c
that c
you c
develop c
heart c
disease c
. c

However c
for i
some c
rare c
diseases c
, c
people c
who c
have c
certain c
gene c
changes c
are c
guaranteed c
to c
develop c
the c
disease c
. c

When c
we c
are c
diagonosed i
out i
with c
certain c
genetic c
disease i
, c
are c
we c
suppose c
to c
disclose c
this c
result c
to c
our c
relatives c
? c

My c
answer c
is c
no c
. c

On c
one c
hand c
, c
we c
do c
not c
want c
this c
potential c
danger c
causing i
firghtenning i
affects i
in c
our c
families c
' c
later c
lives c
. c

When c
people c
around c
us c
know c
that c
we c
got i
certain c
disease i
, c
their c
altitudes i
will c
be i
easily c
changed c
, c
whether c
caring c
us i
too c
much c
or c
keeping c
away c
from c
us c
. c

And c
both c
are c
not c
what c
we c
want c
since c
most c
of c
us c
just c
want c
to c
live c
as c
normal c
people c
. c

Surrounded c
by c
such c
concerns c
, c
it c
is c
very c
likely c
that c
we c
are c
distracted c
to i
worry c
about c
these c
problems c
. c

It c
is c
a c
concern c
that c
will c
be c
with c
us c
during c
our c
whole c
life c
, c
because c
we c
will i
never c
know c
when c
the c
''potential c
bomb' c
' c
will c
explode c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
if c
there c
are c
ways c
can i
help c
us c
to c
control c
or c
cure c
the c
disease c
, c
we c
can c
going i
through c
thses i
process i
from c
the c
scope c
of c
the c
whole c
family c
. c

For c
an i
example c
, c
if c
exercising c
is c
helpful c
for i
family c
potential c
disease c
, c
we c
can c
always c
look c
for c
more c
chances c
for c
the c
family c
to c
go i
exercise c
. c

And i
we c
keep c
track c
of c
all c
family c
members c
health c
conditions c
. c

At c
the c
same c
time c
, c
we c
are c
prepared c
to c
know c
when c
there c
are c
other c
members c
got i
this c
disease c
. c

Here c
I c
want c
to c
share c
Forest'view i
on c
this c
issue c
. c

Although c
some c
people c
feel c
that c
an c
individual c
who c
is c
found c
to c
carry c
a c
dominant c
gene c
for c
Huntington c
's c
disease c
has c
an c
ethical c
obligation c
to c
disclose c
that c
fact c
to c
his c
or c
her c
siblings c
, c
there c
currently c
is c
no c
legal c
requirement c
to c
do c
so c
. c

In c
fact c
, c
requiring c
someone c
to c
communicate c
his c
or c
her c
own c
genetic c
risk c
to c
family c
members c
who c
are c
therefore c
also c
at c
risk c
is c
considered c
by c
many c
to c
be c
ethically c
dubious c
. c

" c

Nothing c
is c
absolute i
right c
or c
wrong c
. c

If c
certain i
disease i
genetic c
test c
is c
very c
accurate c
and c
it c
is c
unavoidable c
and c
necessary c
to c
get c
treatment c
and c
known i
by i
others c
, c
it c
is c
OK c
to c
disclose c
the c
result c
. c

Above c
all c
, c
life c
is c
more c
important c
than c
secret i
. c

Genetic c
risk c
does c
carry c
its i
consequences c
and c
should c
not c
be c
taken c
lightly c
within c
the c
family c
circle c
. c

Afterall c
, c
what c
affects c
one c
family c
may c
or c
may c
not c
affect c
another c
although i
the c
families c
has i
a c
common c
genetic c
make c
up c
, c
shared c
by c
either c
of c
the c
parents c
. c

In c
cases c
where c
an c
individual c
has c
gotten c
to c
know c
of c
a c
genetic c
disorder c
, c
disclosing c
or c
otherwise c
, i
to c
his c
or c
her c
relative c
is i
solely c
a c
matter c
of c
preference c
within c
the c
indivdial i
moral c
system c
. c

The c
issue c
on c
right c
to c
know c
or c
not c
to c
know c
is c
highly c
debatable c
although i
it c
is c
a c
genetic c
risk c
, c
one c
can c
not c
be c
entire i
sure c
because c
the c
genetic c
information c
could c
possibly c
result c
from c
the c
families c
of c
either c
parents c
- c
his i
maternal c
and c
paternal c
uncles c
, c
aunts c
or c
cousin i
. c

This c
also c
means c
that c
as c
soon c
a i
person c
is c
made c
aware c
of c
his c
or c
her c
genetic c
profile c
, c
he c
or c
she c
concurently i
has c
a i
knowledge c
about c
others c
. c

This c
knowledge c
maybe i
relavant i
to c
them c
, i
and i
vice c
versa c
. c

An c
example c
that c
may c
serve c
as c
an c
illustration c
is c
breast c
cancer c
. c

It c
is c
hereditary c
. c

Do i
one c
who c
suffered i
from c
this c
disease c
keep c
it c
a c
secret c
of i
infrom i
their c
relatives c
? c

In c
retrospect c
, c
its c
is c
also c
ones i
duty c
to c
ensure c
that c
he c
or c
she c
undergo c
periodic c
healthchecks c
in i
their c
own c
. c

Sometimes c
some c
family c
structure i
and c
cultural c
beliefs c
can c
influence c
the c
pattern c
of c
communication c
. c

Depending c
on c
whom c
the c
genetic c
risk c
was c
discovered c
from c
: c
the c
son c
or c
daughter c
for c
example c
, c
the c
parents i
who c
knows c
about c
this c
would c
decide c
who c
gets c
told c
and c
whom c
takes c
the c
precedence c
in c
being c
'allowed c
' c
to c
tell c
. c

For c
example c
, c
within c
a c
family c
, c
regardless c
of c
who c
had i
first c
received i
genetic c
information c
, c
parents c
were i
seen c
as c
having c
the c
primary c
responsibility c
to c
pass c
on c
information c
to c
any c
offspring c
, i
either i
adult i
at c
risk c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
a c
woman c
testing c
positive c
for c
BRCA1 c
would c
be c
expected c
to c
allow c
her c
brother c
or c
sister c
to c
disclose c
such c
information c
to c
a c
niece c
or c
nephew c
rather c
than c
do c
it c
herself c
, c
although c
this c
may c
be c
further c
complicated c
by c
an c
individual c
's c
response c
to c
risk c
information c
as c
they c
not i
want c
to c
know c
. c

Hence c
, c
there c
were i
also c
tensions c
if c
participants c
felt i
that c
they c
could i
neither c
pass c
on c
information c
to c
relatives c
who c
needed i
to c
know c
( c
such c
as c
nieces c
and c
nephews c
) c
nor c
persuade c
those c
with c
authority c
( c
the c
parents c
) c
to c
do c
so c
. c

The c
notion c
of c
authority c
also c
extended i
'vertically' c
. c

For c
example c
, c
a c
grandmother c
may c
have c
more c
authority c
to c
pass c
on c
information c
than c
an c
aunt c
, c
even c
when c
she c
is c
not c
at c
genetic c
risk c
herself c
while c
the c
aunt c
is c
. c

From c
a c
practitioner c
's c
perspective c
these i
findings c
are c
important c
because c
if c
lay c
constructs c
of c
the c
family c
and c
kinship c
are c
a c
social c
construct c
they i
may c
not c
be c
in c
line c
with c
geneticists c
' c
views c
of c
family c
relationships c
, c
or c
about c
which c
blood c
( c
or c
non-blood c
) c
relatives c
should c
be c
informed c
and c
by c
whom c
; c
this c
is c
also c
likely c
to c
be c
dependent c
on c
the c
cultural c
and c
ethnic c
context c
. c

Ultimately c
, c
one c
must c
bring c
attention c
to c
who c
may c
benefit c
from c
such c
information c
and c
assisting i
those c
at c
risk c
to c
make c
considered c
decisions c
about c
disclosure c
. c

Whose c
duty c
it c
is c
to c
inform c
at c
risk c
relatives c
or c
not c
greatly c
depends c
on c
the i
personal c
moral i
and c
the c
nature c
of c
how c
'directive c
' c
the c
risk c
is c
to c
them c
. c

People c
with c
close c
blood c
relationship i
generally c
carry c
some c
similar c
genes c
. c

In c
this c
case c
, c
if c
one c
of c
the c
family c
members c
or c
close c
relatives c
is c
found c
to c
carry c
genetic c
risk c
, c
it c
is c
better c
for c
the c
patient c
to c
tell c
his/her c
close c
relatives c
about c
the c
issue c
and c
let c
others c
known i
about c
the c
risk c
so c
that c
his/her c
familay c
members c
are c
able c
to c
perform c
some c
daily c
excesses i
to c
prevent c
the c
potential c
disease c
or c
they c
may c
go c
to c
hospital c
and c
check c
for c
the c
correspongding i
flows c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
although c
the c
annouance i
of c
carrying c
a i
genetic c
risk c
involves c
the c
issue c
of c
self c
privacy c
, c
it c
is c
necessary c
for c
the c
carrier c
to c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
the c
issue c
to c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
in c
order c
for c
them c
to c
prevent c
the c
potential c
disease c
. c

I c
agree c
with c
this c
statement c
to c
a c
large c
extent c
. c

Focus i
on c
the c
negative c
side c
of c
the i
annouance i
of i
genetic c
risk c
first c
. c

Large c
numbers c
of c
patients c
with c
the i
genetic c
risk c
would c
want c
to c
keep c
it c
as c
a c
secret c
as c
the c
genetic c
risk c
may c
indicates i
their c
high c
chance c
to c
carry c
certain c
disease i
. c

Especially c
for c
the i
young i
people c
without i
marrige c
, i
if i
he/she i
is i
known c
to c
have c
some c
genetic c
risk c
, c
it i
may c
have i
certain i
chance c
that c
his/her c
child c
would c
carry c
the c
same c
disease c
, c
but c
not i
in i
certain c
. c

Therefore c
, c
to c
keep c
the c
information c
as c
secret c
to c
his/her c
future c
spouce i
would c
help c
the c
relationship c
. c

Secondly c
, c
annouance i
the c
potential c
risk c
would c
cause c
the c
family c
member c
to c
be c
scared c
of c
this c
certain i
issue c
, i
although i
the c
factor c
would i
not c
be c
that c
serious c
, c
people c
would c
still c
fear c
that c
they c
would c
have c
some c
potential c
disease c
in c
the c
future c
thus i
go c
to c
hospital c
and c
do c
additional c
check i
or c
take c
more c
medicine c
in c
order c
to c
prevent c
the c
disease c
, c
and c
this c
creats c
unnecessary c
costs c
to c
the c
family c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
the c
annouance i
of c
genetic c
risk c
would c
affect c
the c
relationship c
with c
the c
relatives c
as c
sometimes c
others c
may c
think c
not c
to c
stay c
too c
close c
to c
the c
carrier c
so c
that c
they c
have c
less c
chance c
to c
get c
the c
potential c
disease c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
if c
the c
genetic c
risk c
is c
kept c
as c
a c
secret c
, c
although c
it c
may c
benefit c
the c
carrier c
to c
a c
certain c
extend i
and c
help c
to c
keep c
the i
privacy c
, c
but i
it c
has c
much c
larger c
negative c
impacts c
to i
the c
family c
members c
and c
relatives c
. c

First c
, c
for c
the c
case c
of c
marrige i
, c
people i
should c
be c
honest c
and c
tell c
his/her c
spouce i
they c
may c
carry c
certain c
genetic c
risk c
that c
may c
affect c
their c
offsprings i
. c

It c
is c
better c
to c
let c
the c
other c
party c
know c
the c
fact c
than c
after c
the c
baby c
is c
born c
and c
certain i
type c
of c
genetic c
disease c
is c
found c
. c

It c
is c
better c
for c
both c
parties c
to c
be c
honest c
. c

Secondly c
, c
genetic c
disease c
has c
a c
close c
relationship c
with c
the c
born i
gene c
together c
with c
their c
daily c
habits c
. c

For c
example c
, c
if c
a c
carrier c
is c
told c
that c
he/she c
has c
the c
risk c
to c
have c
diabetes c
. c

In c
this c
case c
, c
the c
carrier c
can c
eat c
less c
candies c
and c
chocolates c
to c
prevent c
intake c
to i
much c
sugars c
, c
and c
at c
the c
same c
time c
, c
if c
the c
carrier c
tell c
this c
information c
to c
the c
relatives c
, c
it c
will c
be c
useful c
for c
them c
to c
know c
that c
they c
may c
have c
diabetes c
in c
the c
future c
becouse i
of c
related c
genes c
and c
they c
can c
perform c
the c
same c
exercise c
to c
intake c
less c
sugar c
to c
prevent c
the c
disease c
. c

Otherwise c
, c
if c
the c
other c
parties c
did c
not c
know c
, c
they c
may c
end c
up c
with c
to i
have c
diabete i
in c
the c
future c
without c
any c
prevention c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
we c
could i
tell i
the i
benefits c
of c
telling c
genetic c
risk c
to c
the c
carriers i
relatives c
overweights i
the c
costs c
. c

Therefore c
, c
it c
would c
be c
better c
for c
the c
carrier c
to c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
the c
information c
to c
the i
relatives c
, c
in c
order c
to c
let c
them c
know c
and c
prevent c
the c
potential c
disease c
through c
daily c
exercises i
. c

Among c
all c
kinds c
of c
different c
diseases c
, c
a c
large c
amount c
of c
different c
kinds c
of c
disorders c
are c
caused c
by c
genetic c
reasons c
. c

Genetic c
disorder c
may c
or c
may c
not c
be c
hirataged i
hereditary i
disease c
and c
it c
is c
sometimes c
hard c
to c
find c
out c
one c
has c
these c
kinds c
of c
diseases c
. c

It c
is c
a c
long c
time i
discussion c
that i
whether c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
that c
his c
or c
her c
disease c
is c
caused c
by c
gene i
. c

From c
the c
legal c
aspect c
, c
the c
answer c
is c
no c
but c
from c
the c
ethical c
aspect c
, c
the c
answer c
should c
be c
yes c
. c

We c
ca i
n't c
make c
a c
law c
to c
push c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
his c
genetic c
problem c
. c

It c
is c
immoral c
and c
impractical c
. c

Firstly c
, c
someone c
having c
what i
kinds i
of c
disease c
belongs c
to c
his c
or c
her c
privacy c
. c

Privicy c
protection c
belongs c
to c
one c
's c
human c
rights c
. c

If c
a c
law c
requires c
someone c
to c
tell c
others c
' i
his c
or c
her c
privacy c
especially c
when c
the i
one c
is c
not c
willing c
to c
do c
so c
. c

It i
is c
againt c
his c
or c
her c
human c
rights c
and c
it c
is c
against c
the c
law c
's c
spirit c
. c

The c
law c
's c
spirit c
also c
include i
the i
fairness c
. c

What c
is c
the c
basic c
difference c
between c
genetic c
disorder c
and c
other c
disorders c
. i

It c
is c
unfair c
to c
release c
a c
law c
only i
point i
to c
the i
genetic c
disorder c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
it c
is c
impractical c
to c
make c
such c
a c
law c
. c

A c
good c
law c
should c
be c
clear c
and c
easy c
to c
execute c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
many c
problems c
againt c
the c
execution c
of c
asking c
a c
carrier c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
ralatives i
the c
cause c
of c
his c
or c
her c
diseases c
. c

Firstly c
, c
what c
is c
the c
range c
of c
the c
relatives c
? c

For c
example c
, c
does c
the c
carrier c
only c
need c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
direct c
relatives c
like c
parents c
and c
brothers c
and c
sisters c
or c
does c
he c
also c
need c
to c
tell c
relatives c
like c
his c
grandmother i
's c
sister i
's c
son i
's c
daughter i
's c
nephew i
? c

If c
you c
say c
only i
need i
to c
tell c
direct c
relatives c
, c
it c
will c
be c
against c
the c
fairness c
of c
law i
. c

Other c
relatives c
may c
have c
the c
same c
possibilities c
to i
have c
such i
kind c
of c
disease c
. c

How c
can c
a c
law c
made c
by c
government c
exempt c
such c
a c
group c
of c
people c
from c
preparing c
to c
face c
their c
potetial i
disease c
? c

However c
, c
from c
the c
ethical c
point c
of c
view c
. i

To i
the c
carrier c
himself c
of c
herself c
, c
he c
of i
she c
should c
have c
a c
feeling c
of c
resposiblity i
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
their c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

By c
doing c
this c
,they c
may c
be c
able c
to c
save c
some c
lives c
of c
their c
relatives c
. c

It c
is c
because c
a c
carrier c
with c
bad c
gene i
may c
not c
necessary c
have c
those c
genetic c
disease i
, c
if c
they c
can c
have c
coresponding i
healthy c
lifestyle c
before c
the c
age c
that c
the c
gene c
's c
function c
become i
stronger c
. c

A c
typical c
example c
is c
genetic i
caused c
hypertension i
. c

Hypertension c
can c
be c
caused c
by c
genetic c
problems c
which c
make c
the i
carrier i
harder c
to c
digest c
the c
fat c
and c
salt c
in c
blood c
which i
can c
cause c
hypertension c
. c

People c
usually c
get c
this c
kind c
of c
hypertesion c
after i
they c
become c
adult c
. c

However c
, c
if c
they c
already c
know c
they c
have c
a c
gene c
that c
may c
make c
them c
have c
higher c
possibilities c
to c
get c
hypertention c
. i

They i
can c
build c
a c
daily c
habit c
to c
eat c
less c
salt c
and c
fat c
and c
thus c
to c
avoid c
hypertension c
. c

In c
a c
nutshell c
, c
our c
society c
ca i
n't c
push c
genetic i
problem c
carrier c
to c
tell c
his i
or c
her c
disease c
to c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
but c
he c
or c
she c
should c
be c
willing c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
his c
or c
her c
genetic c
problem c
. c

By c
doing c
so c
, c
less c
of c
his c
or c
her c
beloved c
ones c
will c
suffer c
from c
the c
genetic c
problem c
. c

In c
the c
age c
of c
rapid c
technological c
advancement c
, c
a c
lot c
of c
medical c
breakthroughs c
are c
made c
possible c
. c

Genetic c
testing c
is c
made c
possible c
and c
available c
for i
one c
's c
decision c
to c
undergo c
. c

It c
is c
able c
to c
detect c
the i
illnesses c
or c
diseases c
and c
even c
a c
child c
's c
parentage c
. c

However c
, c
it c
will i
become c
a c
controversial c
issue c
as i
it c
becomes c
a c
dilemma c
for c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
to c
inform c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

If c
the c
knowledge c
of c
the i
genetic c
risk c
was i
to c
be c
shared c
within i
the c
family c
or c
relatives c
, c
there c
might c
have i
chances c
for c
them c
to c
have c
it c
in c
their c
blood c
, i
which c
they i
may c
do i
necessary c
precautions c
to i
prevent c
. c

But c
, c
if c
it c
is c
a c
terminal c
disease c
as c
a c
genetic c
disease c
, c
most c
of c
the c
relatives c
will c
be c
disheartened c
upon c
having i
the c
knowledge i
about c
it c
. c

Therefore c
, c
some c
carriers c
will c
have i
the c
opinion c
of c
keeping c
it c
as c
a c
secret c
. c

This c
essay c
will c
discuss c
about i
whether c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
or c
not c
. c

Some c
said i
that c
the c
genetic c
risk c
that c
is c
found c
in c
a c
person c
should c
be c
kept c
secret c
because c
it c
is c
considered c
as c
a i
personal c
information c
which c
should c
be c
kept c
confidential c
. c

Most c
patients c
will c
be c
depressed c
after c
realising i
his i
or c
her c
conditions i
. c

If c
one c
has c
a c
genetic c
disease c
after c
the c
test c
, c
he c
or c
she c
might c
not c
wish c
to c
inform c
the c
relatives c
as c
he c
might c
ended i
up c
dishearten i
his c
extended c
family c
. c

Some c
will c
wish c
to c
keep c
it c
to c
themselves c
and c
hope c
to c
ensure c
that c
they c
will c
not c
bring c
in c
any c
pessimism c
into c
their c
family c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
some c
will c
wish c
not c
to c
become c
a c
burden c
of i
anyone c
as c
seeking c
medical c
attention c
is c
relatively c
costly c
. c

Hence c
, c
some c
seen i
it c
as c
being c
considerate c
in c
keeping c
the c
genetic c
risk c
of c
getting c
the c
disease c
in i
confidential c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
others c
may c
think c
that c
it c
will i
be c
considerate c
to c
tell c
the c
relatives c
because c
the c
latter c
will c
have c
a c
higher c
tendency c
of c
getting c
the c
same c
genetic c
risk c
. c

Hence c
, c
they c
will c
be c
able c
to c
seek c
help c
from c
medical c
specialists c
to c
find c
a c
cure c
or c
to c
do i
some c
measures c
to c
prevent c
the c
risk c
of c
getting c
the c
disease c
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
it c
will i
depend c
on c
what c
kind c
of c
genetic c
diseases c
, c
given i
in c
the c
context c
of c
current c
medical c
technology c
. c

For c
example c
, c
breast c
cancer c
is c
a c
genetic c
disease c
and c
it c
can c
be c
cured c
if c
it c
is c
being i
realised i
in c
the c
early c
stage i
. c

Hence c
, c
with c
the c
knowledge c
of c
having c
genetic c
risk c
, c
the c
relatives c
of c
this i
genetic c
disease c
will c
do c
a c
medical c
check-up c
, c
which c
might c
save i
them c
in c
realising c
it c
at c
a i
earlier c
stage c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
it c
will c
be c
considerate c
to c
inform c
the c
risk c
of c
getting c
the c
same c
genetic c
disease c
to c
the c
relatives c
. c

Although c
there c
might c
be c
a c
lot c
of c
challenges c
along c
the c
way c
in c
seeking c
medical c
attention c
, c
such c
as c
financial c
issue i
, c
everyone c
should c
be c
given c
the c
rights i
of c
knowing c
their c
family c
's c
inherented i
medical c
conditions c
. c

However c
, c
some c
think c
that c
it c
might c
be c
better c
for c
those i
who i
are c
ignorant c
about c
it c
and i
will i
continue c
leading c
a c
happy c
life c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
some c
may c
think c
that c
even c
knowing c
about c
having c
genetic c
risk c
of c
the i
disease c
, c
it i
will c
just c
adding i
on i
to c
their c
misery c
as c
there c
is c
nothing c
that c
they c
can c
do c
about c
it c
. c

All-in-all c
, c
it c
depends c
on c
individual i
and c
also c
the c
nature c
of c
the c
disease c
, c
but c
he c
or c
she c
should c
be c
obligated c
to c
inform c
the c
relatives c
if c
there c
are c
possibilities c
in c
curing c
or c
preventing c
it c
. c

Genectic i
testing c
is i
a c
personal i
decision c
, i
with i
the c
kowledge c
that c
there c
is c
a c
possiblity c
that c
one i
could c
be c
a c
carrier c
or i
not c
. c

Those c
who c
are c
born c
into c
a c
family c
with c
a c
history c
of c
genetic c
disease c
should c
be c
allowed c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
, i
even i
though c
if c
there c
is c
no c
risk c
at c
all c
. c

Early c
pre-examination c
is c
healthy i
as c
it c
will c
cast c
away c
unwanted c
doubts c
and i
affect i
the c
psychological c
thoughts c
of c
those c
who c
are c
affected c
. c

For c
a c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
, c
there c
should c
be c
choice c
given c
with c
regards c
to c
informing c
his/her c
relatives c
. c

There i
should c
not c
be c
forced c
or c
obligied i
to c
do c
so c
, c
as c
it c
may c
negatively c
and c
drastically c
affect c
the c
emotions c
of c
the c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
. c

With c
regard c
to c
this c
choice c
given c
, c
there c
must c
be c
some c
rules c
to c
regulate c
and c
exercise c
personal c
freedom c
of c
decision c
making c
. c

If c
the c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
is c
a c
minor c
or i
a c
child c
, c
then c
most c
likely c
the c
decision c
of c
informing c
the c
relative c
should c
be c
made c
with c
the c
consideration c
of c
the c
patients i
parents c
or c
legal c
guardian c
. c

Such c
patients c
are c
still c
emotionally c
volatile c
or c
they c
may c
be c
unaware c
of c
the c
consequences c
of c
such c
genetic c
disorder c
due c
to c
their c
young c
age c
. c

Furthermore c
the c
act c
of c
informing c
others c
without c
the c
consent c
from c
their c
parents c
or c
the c
patients c
itself i
could c
harm c
the c
psychological c
state c
of c
the c
affected c
family c
. c

Thus c
, c
much c
thought c
need i
to c
put i
on i
the c
immediate c
family c
as c
it c
could c
caused i
a c
stir c
of c
unwanted c
events c
from c
the c
patient c
or c
the c
family c
members c
itself i
. c

Some c
family i
may c
feel c
hurt c
, c
with c
regards c
to c
their c
family c
pride c
or c
reputation c
, c
on c
having i
the c
knowledge c
of c
such c
genetic i
disorder c
running c
in c
their c
family c
. c

However c
, c
there i
is i
a c
role i
and c
a c
sense i
of c
responsibility c
to c
inform c
their c
relatives c
since c
it c
is c
a c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

There c
might c
be c
a c
possibility c
that c
the c
genetic c
disorder c
could c
also c
affect c
their c
relatives c
and c
any c
other c
families i
within c
the c
same c
family c
tree c
. c

The c
importance c
of c
informing c
relatives c
of c
such c
genetic c
disease c
is c
vital c
as c
it c
may c
help c
to c
raise c
awareness c
and c
prevention i
towards i
the c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

Also c
, c
this c
known c
information c
will c
help c
their i
relatives c
to c
make c
informed c
decisions c
and c
tosimilarly i
undergo c
genetic c
testingto i
find c
out c
about c
the i
outcome i
. c

Thus c
, c
having c
the c
knowledge c
that c
such c
genetic c
disorder c
is c
benign c
would c
be c
beneficial c
towards c
their c
emotinal c
thoughts i
. c

And c
if c
the c
results c
turn c
out c
to c
be c
otherwise c
, c
then c
the c
family c
can c
be c
prepared c
emotionally c
and c
psychologically c
of i
the c
future c
outcome c
and c
aid i
them c
in c
making c
upcoming i
decisions c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
the c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
would c
be c
showered c
with c
moral c
and c
emotional c
support c
from c
their c
relatives c
if c
it c
is c
been i
made c
known c
to c
them c
. c

Having c
support c
from c
relatives c
are i
vital c
as c
they c
ensure c
the i
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
that c
he/she c
is c
not c
alone c
in c
facing c
this c
illness c
and c
it c
will c
certainly c
provide c
a c
morale c
boost c
as c
the c
whole c
family c
will c
share c
a c
common c
sentiment c
with c
regards c
towards c
the c
future c
prospect c
of c
the c
genetic c
disorder c
which c
could c
be c
inherited c
by c
anyone c
in c
the c
family c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the c
decision c
to c
inform c
relatives c
of c
such c
genetic c
disorder c
will c
be c
dependent c
of i
the c
situation c
and c
backgroung i
of c
the c
affected c
family c
, i
with i
the c
liberty c
of c
choice c
given c
to c
them c
in c
making c
the c
decision c
of c
informing c
others c
. c

A c
person c
with c
a c
disorder c
, c
regardless c
of c
mental i
or c
physical c
disorder c
, c
is c
always i
easy i
to c
be c
awared i
by c
his c
or c
her c
families i
. c

When c
things c
come c
to c
genetic c
issues c
, c
it c
is c
not c
that c
simple c
anymore c
. c

Genetic c
disorder c
inheritance c
is c
generation i
by c
generation c
, c
but c
not c
all c
of c
the c
offsprings i
show i
the c
relevant c
symptoms c
. c

Sometimes c
a c
family c
with c
potential c
genetic c
disorder c
risk c
may c
not c
be c
able c
to c
detect c
the c
potential c
harm c
inside c
their c
bodies c
as c
none c
of c
their c
members c
reflect c
any c
observable c
disorder c
symptoms c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
in c
the c
case c
that c
when c
one c
of c
the c
members c
happen i
to c
feel c
uncomfortable c
or c
unnormal i
, c
he c
or c
she c
should c
aware i
that i
whether c
the c
disorder c
in c
his c
or c
her c
body c
is c
a c
genetic c
risk c
or c
not c
. c

Afterward i
, c
the c
carrier c
will c
face c
a c
serious c
ethical c
issue c
, c
which c
is c
to c
reveal c
the c
problem c
to c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
or c
not c
. c

If c
the c
disorder c
symptoms c
reflect i
on c
a c
kid i
, c
the c
parent c
will c
be c
informed c
by c
the c
medics c
for i
sure c
, c
then c
the c
whole c
family c
will c
stay c
alert c
to c
their c
bodies i
' c
condition c
. c

On i
contrary c
, c
if c
the c
carrier c
is c
an c
adult c
, c
who i
has c
his c
own c
choice c
to c
choose c
whether c
to c
inform c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
the c
risk c
, c
that c
will c
be c
more c
complex c
. c

One c
may c
think c
that c
if c
the c
carrier c
is c
a c
caring c
person c
who c
loves c
his c
or c
her c
family c
more c
than c
himself c
, c
there c
is c
no c
doubt c
that c
he c
or c
she c
will c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
about c
the c
issue c
. c

That c
is c
true c
and c
of c
course c
it c
is c
the c
obligation c
of c
a c
family c
member c
to c
protect c
and c
take c
care c
of c
the c
family c
. c

Think i
of c
the c
other c
way c
, c
if c
a c
child c
of c
the c
family c
knows c
that c
he c
has c
the c
risk c
to i
become i
a c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
, c
and c
the c
risk c
might c
as i
well c
inherit c
to c
his c
child c
in c
the c
future c
, c
his c
whole c
life c
will c
be c
in c
a c
dilenma c
. c

And i
of i
course c
, c
he c
or c
she c
will c
think c
of c
not c
having c
any c
child c
after c
getting c
married c
, c
and c
the c
same c
thought c
goes c
to c
the c
cousins c
as c
well c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
the c
family c
generation c
stops c
by c
the c
moment c
the c
adult c
carrier c
announces c
his c
issue c
. c

In c
China c
, c
the c
older c
generation c
with c
traditional c
culture i
background i
, c
will c
always c
think c
of c
having c
more c
children c
as c
well c
as c
grandchildren c
, c
to c
make c
the c
family c
liven i
up c
and c
stronger i
. c

The c
reason i
behind i
is c
that c
after c
WOWII c
the c
population c
of c
China c
decreased c
dramatically c
and c
so c
the c
government c
encourage i
the c
people c
to c
give i
more c
birth c
. c

During c
that c
period c
, c
if c
one c
of c
the c
family c
member i
reflects i
genetic c
disorder c
symptoms c
, c
he c
will i
fell i
in i
an c
ethical c
dilenma c
for i
sure c
. c

The c
medical c
treatment c
technology c
during c
that c
time c
is i
not c
advanced c
enough c
to c
completely c
cure c
him c
. c

He c
has i
to c
choose c
whether i
to c
protect c
his c
family c
or i
make c
his c
family c
more c
prosperity i
with i
a c
potential c
generic i
risk c
. c

And c
so c
, c
he c
would c
have c
chosen c
not c
to c
undergo c
generic c
disorder c
testing c
and c
let c
the c
truth c
be c
mined i
forever c
. c

This c
kind c
of c
ethical c
issue c
can c
not c
be c
judged c
by c
the i
others c
because c
they c
will c
not c
understand c
the c
position c
and c
duty c
of c
the c
carrier i
in c
the c
family c
. c

In c
conclude i
, c
people c
should c
think c
carefully c
of i
what c
is i
the c
consequences c
of c
telling c
the c
relatives c
his i
or c
her c
generic c
disorder c
issue c
. c

It c
is c
an c
obligation c
for c
a c
carrier c
to c
inform c
his c
relatives c
, c
but c
also c
an c
obligation c
for c
a c
family c
member c
to c
liven i
up c
the c
family c
. c

Regardlessly i
, c
if c
the c
disorder c
is c
rarely i
to c
be c
fatal c
, c
or c
it c
does c
not c
caused i
any c
inconvenience c
to c
the c
carrier c
, c
revealing c
the c
truth c
is c
always c
the c
right c
thing c
to c
do c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
the c
carrier c
should c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
it c
. c

One c
of c
the c
reasons c
why c
is c
because c
as c
a c
carrier c
, c
she c
or c
he c
needs c
a i
mental c
support c
to c
go c
through c
with i
this c
situation c
. c

It c
will i
be c
hard c
for c
an c
individual c
to c
deal c
with c
the c
issue c
on c
its i
own c
. c

By c
telling c
to i
his c
or c
her c
family c
other c
than c
being c
a c
support c
, c
they c
could c
possibly c
help c
her c
to c
get c
alternative c
solutions c
to c
the c
problem c
that c
she c
is c
facing c
right i
now c
. c

Other c
than c
that c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
the c
stong c
bond c
we c
have c
with c
our c
family c
is c
the c
biggest c
pillar c
of c
support c
to c
the c
carrier c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
as c
it c
is c
a c
genetic c
problem c
, c
it c
will i
be c
better c
for c
the c
carrier c
to c
inform c
his c
or c
her c
family c
as c
other c
family c
member i
might c
experience c
the c
same c
thing c
. c

By c
making c
sure c
that c
they c
are c
aware c
of c
this c
genetic c
problem c
, c
they c
could c
have c
a c
full c
check-up c
for c
themselves c
and c
it i
will c
be c
better c
if c
they c
could c
even c
prevent c
it c
from c
happening c
to c
themselves c
. c

I c
find c
that c
it c
is c
important c
to c
inform c
especially c
if c
it c
is c
contagious c
, i
the c
carrier c
could c
prevent c
the c
disease c
from c
spreading c
out c
to c
the i
society c
. c

For c
every c
action i
there c
is i
always c
pros c
and c
cons c
. c

I c
believe c
that c
some c
of c
the c
carriers c
will c
choose c
to c
not c
reveal c
their c
disease c
to c
the c
family c
members c
as c
they c
do c
not c
want c
to c
make c
their c
family c
members c
worry c
and c
feel c
uncomfortable c
or c
even c
feel c
ostracized c
by c
them c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
as c
it c
could c
incur c
spending c
a c
lots i
of c
money c
for c
the c
treatment c
, c
the c
carrier c
might c
not c
want c
to c
be c
the i
burden c
in c
her c
family c
. c

I c
could c
understand c
the c
feeling c
of c
the c
carrier c
. c

She c
or c
he c
does c
not c
want c
to c
be c
the c
source c
of c
unhappiness c
in c
thefamily i
. c

However c
, c
we c
will c
never c
know c
whether c
this i
negative c
effects c
will c
happen c
when c
the c
carrier c
decide i
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
of c
the i
his c
or c
her c
condition c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
personally c
I c
feel c
that c
it c
is c
better c
for c
the c
carrier c
to c
inform c
her c
family c
members c
about c
the c
issue c
. c

The c
carrier c
should c
be c
honest c
with c
his c
or c
her c
feeling c
and c
I c
find c
that c
it c
is c
the c
right c
of c
the c
family c
member c
to c
know c
what c
is c
going c
on c
to i
his c
or c
her c
life c
. c

If c
anything c
wrong c
happened c
to c
the c
carrier c
's c
life c
, c
without c
informing c
the c
family c
members c
it c
could c
make i
a i
huge c
regret c
in c
their c
life c
if c
she c
leaves c
without c
them c
knowing c
about c
it c
. c

On c
top c
of c
that c
, c
it c
is c
better c
to c
think c
about c
solutions c
for c
her c
problem c
with c
the c
family c
members c
as c
there c
are c
more c
heads c
to c
think c
about c
it c
rather c
than c
thinking c
about c
it c
alone c
and c
struggling c
on c
your c
own c
. c

In c
the c
end c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
the c
support c
in c
terms c
of c
mental c
or c
even c
monetary c
from i
your i
family c
could c
help c
the c
carrier c
to c
fight c
against c
the c
genetic c
disease c
. c

True c
enough c
that i
there c
are c
lots c
of c
cancer c
's i
patient i
who c
were i
given c
second c
choice i
to c
live c
as c
a i
normal c
person i
as c
they c
have c
a i
strong c
mental c
support c
from c
their c
loved c
one i
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
as c
long c
as c
we c
keep c
our c
mind c
healthy c
and c
strong c
, c
we c
can c
fight c
any c
disease c
as c
they c
come c
to c
us c
when i
we c
are c
fragile c
and c
weak c
. c

As c
the i
techonology c
has c
been c
advancing c
, c
it c
has c
reached c
a c
stage c
whereby c
the c
advancement c
triggers c
some c
ethical c
dilemmas c
in c
relation c
to c
the c
acutual i
use c
of c
the c
techonology c
. c

Genetic c
testing c
has c
been c
made c
possible- c
it c
has c
become c
easy c
to c
tell c
if c
one c
is c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
through c
genetic c
testing c
. c

If c
used c
for c
a c
good c
purpose c
, c
it c
can c
prevent c
unnecessary c
unhappiness c
, c
however c
, c
it c
could c
also c
make c
situation i
worse c
by c
revealing c
who c
the c
carrier c
is c
, c
in c
the c
family c
. c

The c
question c
given c
is c
whether c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
and c
I c
think c
that c
the c
carrier c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
do c
so c
because c
I c
belive c
that c
he c
or c
she c
has c
right i
not c
to c
know c
. c

Firstly c
, c
genetic c
testing c
is c
not c
something c
that c
is c
compulsory c
. c

Of c
course c
, c
some c
people c
may c
do c
it c
to c
make c
their c
futures c
slightly c
happier c
, c
however c
, c
the c
carrier c
, c
before c
the c
testing c
, c
can c
choose c
not c
to c
go c
for c
the c
test c
and c
simply c
live c
with c
unknowns c
and c
accept c
the c
facts c
. c

If c
he c
chooses c
to c
live c
in c
the c
uncertainty c
that c
the c
gene c
holds c
and c
willing i
to c
accept c
it c
, c
he c
could c
do c
that c
, c
and c
it c
has c
been c
something c
that c
is c
'normal c
' c
to c
everyone c
in c
the c
past c
as c
gentic i
testing c
was c
not c
possible c
. c

It c
could c
rather c
be c
better c
for c
him c
or c
her c
this c
way c
. c

Some c
people c
might c
say c
that c
it c
is c
a c
form c
of c
prevention c
of c
giving c
birth c
to c
disabled c
lives c
and c
making c
them c
suffer c
in c
real-life c
. c

I c
personally c
think c
this c
ist i
he i
right c
purpose c
of c
going c
through c
the c
genetic c
testing c
, c
so c
that c
a c
family c
who c
can c
not c
afford c
to c
have c
a c
disabled c
kid c
do i
not c
have c
to c
give c
birth c
to c
their c
child c
and c
make c
the c
entire c
family c
suffer c
. c

However c
, c
I c
belive i
that c
the c
carrier c
has c
right i
not c
to c
obligate i
to c
tell c
anyone c
but c
has c
responsibility c
to c
take c
an c
action c
to c
prevent c
any c
ethical c
dilemma c
. c

If c
the c
result c
turned c
out c
something i
that c
the c
carrier c
can i
not c
accept c
then c
it c
would c
have c
been c
better c
not c
knowing c
the c
truth c
. c

I c
belive i
that c
even c
the c
carrier c
has c
the c
right c
not c
to c
know c
the c
true i
fact c
. c

After c
realizing i
the i
he c
or c
she c
is c
tshe i
carrier c
, c
the c
emotional c
damage c
would c
be c
hard c
to c
bear c
. c

It c
could c
possibly c
causes i
a c
problem c
in c
a c
family c
due i
to c
the c
fact c
and c
creates i
more c
unhappiness c
int i
the c
family c
. c

Overall c
, c
I c
belive i
that c
it c
entirely i
depends c
on c
the c
carrier c
to c
share c
the c
hard c
facts c
and c
face c
it c
with c
relatives c
but c
he c
has i
no c
obligation c
to c
tell c
still c
. c

In c
fact c
, c
I c
strongly c
think c
that c
the c
carrier c
should c
weigh c
both c
the c
positive c
and c
negative c
consequences c
of c
taking c
the c
genetic c
testing i
and c
tak i
an i
appropriate c
action c
to i
the c
results c
. c

The c
emotional c
depression c
that c
the c
carrier c
might c
get c
and c
the c
sense c
of c
guilty i
can c
be c
more c
than c
expected c
and c
could c
be c
a c
burden c
in c
mind c
for c
the i
rest c
of c
the c
life c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
without c
knowing c
any i
genetic c
disorder c
and c
accepting i
the c
fact c
, c
the c
family c
will c
stay c
positive c
and c
work c
together c
to c
overcome c
the i
diability i
. c

I c
think c
the c
family c
will c
stay c
mentally c
healty c
as c
it c
is c
, c
without c
having c
emtional i
stress c
. c

Debates c
have c
been c
around c
for c
years c
, i
that i
should c
a c
carrier c
for i
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
be c
obligated c
to c
inform c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. i

Any c
individual c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
disorder c
has c
the c
right c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
, c
but c
whether c
the c
results c
should c
be c
informed c
to c
others c
, c
especially c
close c
family c
or c
relatives c
, c
is c
the c
topic c
that i
worth c
discussing c
. c

This c
is c
an c
issue i
need i
to c
be c
addressed c
as i
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma c
is c
involved c
. c

In c
this c
essay c
, c
few i
arguments c
will c
be c
pointed c
out c
in c
the i
support c
of i
view c
for c
any c
carrier c
of c
that c
known c
genetic c
risk c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

When c
we c
were c
born c
, c
we c
were c
surrounded c
by c
our c
family c
and c
relatives c
, c
with c
them c
welcoming c
us c
to c
this c
new c
world c
. c

We c
were c
crying c
hard c
but c
we c
are i
not c
alone c
, i
it i
's i
our c
family c
and c
relatives c
that c
grow i
us c
up c
. c

Hence c
, c
they c
should c
be c
the c
people c
be i
grateful c
for c
and c
the c
people c
we c
would c
like c
to c
share c
the c
joy c
together i
. c

However c
, c
in c
the c
case c
pertaining c
to c
any c
health c
issue c
or c
to c
the c
extent c
of c
serious c
disorder c
, c
it i
may c
seems i
no c
point c
of i
sharing c
but c
this c
involves c
more c
than c
just c
sharing i
of c
bad c
news c
. c

One c
definitely c
has c
the c
right c
to c
disclose c
his c
or c
her c
health c
issues c
to c
anyone c
, c
but c
it c
's i
also i
one c
's c
responsibility c
to c
inform c
the i
family c
and c
close c
relatives c
. i

As i
the c
case c
of i
health c
issue c
is c
related c
to c
genetic c
risk c
, c
with c
keyword i
on c
" c
genetic c
" c
which c
highlights c
the c
risk c
of c
passing c
down c
the c
disorder c
to c
the c
next c
generation c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
would c
agree c
to i
that c
it i
's c
obligated c
for c
a c
carrier c
of c
known i
genetic c
risk c
to i
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
to c
avoid c
any c
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma c
that c
could c
be i
raise c
up c
in c
the c
future c
. c

Despite i
one c
may c
argue c
that c
it c
's i
still i
up c
to c
the c
individual c
to c
disclose i
such c
health i
issue c
or c
to c
bear c
it c
within i
him/herself c
, c
it c
's i
certainly c
helpful c
to c
share c
with c
close c
relatives c
, c
for c
a c
proper c
discussion c
for c
solutions c
. c

By c
doing c
so c
, c
one c
will c
feel c
less c
stressful i
in c
facing c
such c
disorder i
risk c
. c

Relatives c
will c
certainly c
be c
supportive c
and c
show c
more c
caring c
towards c
the c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
. c

By c
informing c
them c
, c
the c
carrier c
is c
never c
alone c
in c
fighting c
the c
battle c
of i
such c
disorder i
risk c
. c

On c
top c
of c
that c
, c
as c
the c
genetic c
risk c
may c
pass c
down c
to c
next i
generation c
, c
thus i
it c
will c
involve c
more c
than c
just c
one c
family c
. c

It i
is c
therefore i
I c
would c
agree c
for c
the c
obligation c
of c
telling c
the c
relatives c
of c
both c
parties c
when c
one c
is c
about c
to c
get c
married c
and c
have c
a c
plan c
for c
giving c
birth c
. c

This c
would c
avoid c
the c
rise c
of c
more c
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma i
. c

There c
are c
more c
intangible c
advantages c
that c
could c
support c
the c
stand c
of c
informing c
the c
relatives c
once c
the c
results c
are c
known c
after c
the c
test c
conducted i
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
in c
order c
to c
avoid c
the c
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma c
, c
it c
is c
best c
for c
any c
carrier c
of c
known c
genetic c
risk c
to c
inform c
his/her c
relatives c
. c

The c
benefits c
of c
doing c
so c
are i
able c
to c
outweigh c
its i
disadvantages c
. c

More c
supports i
must c
be c
provided c
through c
different c
means c
to c
give c
better c
direction c
when c
one c
is c
standing i
of c
such c
junction c
whether c
should i
him/her c
to c
inform c
the i
relatives c
. c

The c
decision c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
can c
only c
be c
made c
by c
the c
individual c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
disorder c
. c

This c
is c
the c
common c
law c
in c
the i
society c
. c

However c
, c
it c
leads c
to c
a c
new c
problem c
that i
" c
should c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
? c

" c
This c
issue c
has c
been c
discussed c
for c
a c
long c
time c
. c

However c
, c
there c
is c
still c
a c
diversity c
of c
point i
of c
views i
among c
the i
people c
. c

Thus c
, c
we c
are c
going c
to c
identify c
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
the c
issue c
which i
is c
" c
should c
or c
should c
not c
" c
. c

Firstly c
, c
I c
believe c
most c
of c
us c
will c
agree c
with c
the c
sentences i
below c
: c
" c
I c
will c
be c
anxious c
about c
my c
families i
when c
he c
or c
she c
told i
me c
that c
he c
or c
she c
was i
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
" c
. c

Frequently c
, c
the c
intention c
of c
the c
carriers c
does i
not c
want i
to c
tell c
their c
families i
are i
to c
continue c
their c
own c
life c
without c
the i
anxious i
of i
families c
. c

It c
is c
obvious c
that c
there i
will i
be c
better c
for c
one c
person c
to c
be c
worried c
than c
many c
. c

However c
, c
many c
of c
the c
carriers c
are c
not c
strong c
enough c
to c
overcome c
the c
challenges c
oneself i
. c

With c
the c
families c
' c
support c
, c
there c
must c
be c
more c
energy c
to c
fight c
against c
with i
the c
demon c
. c

Demon i
is c
not c
easily c
to i
be c
defeated c
and c
it i
is c
required c
much c
of c
energy c
and c
psychological c
support c
. c

Families c
give c
you c
the c
courage c
and c
support c
which c
you c
can c
not c
retrieve c
by c
yourself c
. c

That c
is c
the c
most c
essential c
elements i
to c
overcome c
the c
challenges c
. c

Besides c
that c
, c
the c
risk c
of c
the c
known c
genetic c
is i
very i
serious c
that c
it c
can c
not c
be c
described c
. c

The c
seriousness c
can c
be c
larger i
than c
our c
imagination c
. c

Lying c
on c
the c
bed c
for c
the i
remaining c
life i
, c
and i
even c
die i
immediately i
, i
these c
are c
the c
consequences c
which c
we c
can c
not c
imagine c
. c

Families c
are c
our i
dearest c
in c
our c
life c
. c

Without c
their c
concern c
and c
support c
, c
we i
are i
hard c
to c
stay c
until i
this i
time c
. c

They c
play c
the i
important c
role c
in c
our c
life c
which c
can c
not c
be c
substituted c
. c

A c
known c
genetic c
risk c
can c
also c
affect c
our c
next c
generation c
critically c
. c

Therefore c
, c
it c
is c
our c
responsibility c
to c
tell c
the i
relatives c
to c
prevent c
the c
occurrence c
of c
undesired c
consequences c
. c

Generally c
, c
the c
clinic c
or c
hospital c
will c
not c
tell c
the c
carrier c
's c
families i
without c
the c
agreement c
of c
carrier i
. c

It c
is c
the c
ethic c
of c
staff i
in c
hospital c
to c
keep c
the c
secret c
of c
any c
patients c
. c

We c
can c
not c
blame c
them c
that i
they c
are c
liable c
to i
the i
undesired c
consequences c
. c

However c
, c
hospital i
can c
provide c
a c
councilor c
to c
advice i
the c
carrier c
about c
the c
action c
can i
be c
taken c
. c

Therefore c
, c
this i
kind i
of c
circumstances c
will c
not c
be i
happened c
again c
and c
again c
. c

It c
is c
a c
method c
that c
benefits c
two c
parties i
which c
is c
a c
win-win c
situation c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
is c
encouraged c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
the c
known c
genetic c
risk c
. c

However c
, c
there c
may c
be c
some c
special c
case c
that c
is c
hard c
to c
be c
defined c
. c

Thus c
, c
advice c
from c
hospital c
plays c
the i
important c
role c
for i
this i
. c

Carrier i
is c
responsible c
to c
balance c
his c
or c
her c
own c
interest c
and c
the c
benefits c
of c
family i
and c
even c
society c
. c

It c
is c
a c
hard c
decision c
to c
make c
but c
with c
the c
most c
appropriate c
way i
, c
it i
will c
create c
great c
circumstances c
for c
the c
carrier c
and c
families c
in c
the c
future c
. c

With c
the c
risk c
of c
being i
genetically i
disorder i
, c
many c
individuals c
have c
done i
the c
decision c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
. c

With c
the c
nature i
that c
the c
results c
will c
be c
known c
once c
the c
tests c
are c
done c
, c
each c
individual c
that c
is c
diagnosed c
to c
be c
a c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
face i
an c
ethical c
problem c
: c
They i
should c
warn c
their c
relatives c
about c
the c
risking c
of c
being c
the c
same c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
. i

Or c
they i
can c
choose c
to c
keep c
silent c
until c
the c
next c
carrier c
is c
diagnosed c
. i

In c
the i
view c
of c
my c
point c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
, c
with c
the c
support c
of c
the c
following c
reasons c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
from c
the c
angle c
of c
human c
right i
, c
a c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
the c
truth c
to c
others c
. c

This c
diagnosis c
can c
be c
regarded c
as c
a c
kind c
of c
privacy c
to c
carriers c
. c

They c
may c
do i
not c
want c
this c
truth c
to c
influence c
their c
life c
or i
want c
to c
keep c
it c
as c
a c
secret c
and c
do i
not c
others i
know c
about c
it c
. c

This c
is c
reasonable c
since c
the c
exposure c
of c
the c
truth c
of c
being c
a c
carrier c
may c
make i
them c
be i
discriminated c
or i
sympothized i
by c
others c
which c
is i
not c
positive c
factors c
brought i
to i
their c
life i
. c

Seconly i
, c
the c
relatives c
of c
the c
carrier c
can c
also c
choose c
to c
do c
genetic c
testing c
regardless c
of c
the c
dignosis c
of c
the c
carrier c
. c

When c
people c
want c
to c
check c
whether c
they c
are c
genetic c
risk c
carriers c
, c
they c
can c
go c
and c
approach c
a c
doctor c
to c
consult i
about c
it c
. c

If c
they c
do c
not c
want c
to c
think c
too c
much c
of i
it c
and c
view c
it c
as c
a c
trouble i
, c
they c
may c
just c
ignore c
the c
possibility c
. c

However c
, c
if c
a c
dignosed c
carrier c
is c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
, c
the c
relatives c
will c
be c
forced c
to c
know c
their c
higher c
chance i
of c
being c
genetic c
risk c
carriers c
. c

This c
obeys i
their c
own c
willingness c
as c
in c
they c
have c
to c
accept c
the c
truth c
which c
may c
make c
their i
following i
life c
miserable c
. c

Many c
people c
many i
argue c
that c
setting i
the c
obligation c
may c
help c
more c
people c
, c
who c
are c
the c
relatives c
of c
the c
carriers c
, c
save c
their c
lives c
with i
a c
larger c
opportunity c
because c
of c
the c
early c
diagnosis c
. c

However c
, c
this c
is c
not c
exactly c
true c
when c
other c
factors c
including c
psychological c
influence c
, i
social c
influence c
, c
are c
taken c
into c
consideration c
. c

If c
one c
such c
relative c
is c
told c
that c
he c
or c
she c
may c
have c
higher i
risk c
of c
getting c
sick c
, c
he c
or c
she c
may c
have i
be c
scared c
about c
the c
unknown c
life i
, i
partners c
, c
spouse i
and c
colleagues c
may c
choose c
to c
leave c
, c
and c
many c
other c
situations i
may c
happen i
which c
means c
the c
relative c
's c
life c
may c
be c
ruined c
. c

On c
the c
other c
side i
, c
as c
stated c
above c
, c
a c
person c
who c
want i
to c
confirm c
and c
has c
been c
prepared c
to c
face c
the c
result c
can c
choose c
to c
do c
the c
genetic c
testing c
individually c
. c

In c
a c
nutshell c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
have c
their c
own c
right c
to c
decide c
whether c
to c
tell c
their c
relatives c
or c
not c
. c

This c
should c
be c
accepted c
from c
the c
point c
of c
human c
right i
, c
freedom c
of c
acceptance c
of c
relatives c
as c
well c
as c
many c
other c
social c
reasons c
. c

Otherwise c
, c
making c
it c
an c
obligation c
will c
restric i
the c
choice c
of c
carriers c
and c
bring c
a c
lot c
of c
confusion c
to c
their c
relatives c
. c

For c
a c
carrier c
of c
genetic c
disorder c
to i
know c
the c
fact c
that c
he c
or c
she c
is c
a c
carrier c
, i
it c
causes c
more c
dilemma c
rather i
than c
getting c
the c
disorder c
. c

I c
agree c
that c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
is c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

There c
are c
four c
reasons c
why c
people c
do i
n't c
have c
to c
be c
shy i
and c
share i
their c
problems c
regarding c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

Firstly c
, c
the c
carrier c
and c
his c
or c
her c
family c
can c
take c
precautions c
, i
physically c
by c
actions c
to c
reduce c
the c
chance c
of c
it c
being c
inherited c
to c
offspring c
and i
, c
mentally c
if i
the c
action c
fails c
to c
prevent c
it c
being c
inherited c
. c

Many c
syndromes c
such c
as c
Down c
Syndrome c
and c
Taylor c
Syndrome c
can c
be c
prevented c
to i
happen c
if c
the c
mother c
undergo i
proper c
medication c
and c
do i
n't c
consume c
harmful i
goods i
during c
the c
pregnancy c
period c
. c

This c
information c
may c
not c
be c
known c
by c
the c
mother c
if c
she c
does c
n't c
tell c
her c
relatives c
regarding c
her c
condition c
. c

More i
people c
( c
relatives c
) c
know i
her c
problem c
, c
more i
information i
channel c
is i
provided c
. c

If c
all c
efforts c
have c
been c
made c
but c
the c
children c
still c
suffer c
from c
the c
syndrome c
then i
the c
family c
have i
to c
accept c
this c
fact c
and c
do c
whatever c
they i
can c
to c
bring i
a c
good c
environment c
for c
their i
children c
's c
growth c
. c

This c
is c
not c
the c
parent c
's c
fault c
because c
there c
is c
still c
chances c
of c
the c
gene c
being c
inherited c
. c

So c
, c
they c
have c
to c
also c
prepare c
mentally c
. c

Secondly c
, c
genetic c
diseases c
costs i
highly i
for c
the i
treatment c
and c
medication c
. c

Albinism c
is c
one i
of c
the c
examples i
. c

The i
people i
with c
albinism c
have c
sensitive c
skin c
and c
it i
needs c
regular c
treatment c
. c

Unlike c
people c
with c
high i
proportion c
of c
skin c
pigment c
, c
people c
with c
albinism c
is i
prone c
to c
sunburn c
and c
other c
skin c
diseases c
. c

If c
they c
do c
n't i
treat c
their c
body c
well c
, c
such c
as c
by c
using c
sunglasses c
or c
wearing c
sunscreen c
in i
outdoor i
, c
the c
chances c
are c
good i
that c
they c
will c
get c
skin c
problems c
that c
may c
also c
lead c
to c
cancer c
. c

Once c
you c
suffer c
from c
cancer c
, c
the c
medication c
cost c
is c
very c
expensive c
. c

To c
prevent c
the c
bigger c
problem c
to i
happen c
, c
it c
takes c
a c
lot c
of c
effort c
to c
take c
care c
of c
your c
body c
. c

If c
the c
carrier c
does c
n't i
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
, c
it c
may c
be c
too c
late c
to c
get c
their c
support c
and c
prepare c
financially c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
some c
diseases c
are c
not c
noticeable c
and c
may c
lead c
to c
serious c
health c
problems c
. c

One c
of c
the i
diseases c
is c
sickle c
cell c
trait c
. c

Usually c
people c
are c
not c
aware c
if c
they c
carry c
the c
sickle c
cell c
gene c
and c
this c
may c
lead c
to c
circulatory c
problem i
such c
as c
blood c
blocking i
. c

If c
the c
parents c
know c
that c
one c
of c
them c
is c
a c
carrier c
and c
disclose i
the c
information c
to c
their c
relatives c
then i
they c
can c
bring c
their c
children c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
and c
do i
n't c
need c
to i
be c
shy i
of i
it i
because c
it c
is c
for c
the c
sake c
of c
their c
children c
's c
health c
. c

Fourthly c
, c
it c
is c
important c
for c
the c
parents c
to c
give c
mental i
boost c
for i
their c
children c
with c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

When c
their c
children c
become c
teenagers c
, c
a c
lot c
of c
social c
problems c
may c
arise c
. c

People c
and c
friends c
often c
mock c
of i
your i
conditions c
. c

A c
strong c
mental c
condition c
and c
conviction c
must c
be c
build i
from c
within c
and c
from c
the c
closest c
ones c
. c

If c
not c
their c
family c
then i
who c
else c
that i
are i
willing c
to c
do c
that c
? c

It c
is c
not c
a c
heavy c
job c
for c
the c
family c
if c
they c
have c
prepare i
their i
mental i
first c
by c
disclosing c
the c
information c
of c
the c
probability c
that c
their c
children c
may c
suffer c
from c
the c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

In c
this c
modern c
world c
, c
the i
technologies c
were i
improved c
a c
lot c
compared c
with i
the c
last c
century c
. c

Particularly c
, c
in c
the c
medical c
field c
, c
there c
is i
a c
great c
improvement c
in c
many c
treatments c
for c
many c
formally c
incurable c
diseases c
, c
and c
genetic c
testing c
is c
one c
of c
the c
methods c
which c
were i
used c
to c
diagnose c
an c
individual c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

The c
medical c
authorities c
claimed i
that c
only c
the c
individual c
who c
is c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
genetic c
disorder c
can c
make c
the c
decision c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
. c

However c
, c
once c
a c
test c
has c
been c
conducted c
and c
the c
results c
are c
known c
, c
a c
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma c
is c
born c
. c

The c
question c
is c
whether c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
the c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
has c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
this c
. c

This c
is c
because c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
have c
the c
right c
to c
know c
about i
this i
. c

As c
many c
people c
realize c
, c
a c
genetic c
disorder c
can c
be c
related i
to c
the c
carrier c
's c
relatives c
, c
that c
is c
, c
one c
of c
the c
family c
members c
is c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
genetic c
disorder c
means i
that c
other c
family c
members c
also c
have c
almost i
the c
equally c
risk c
to c
have c
it c
, i
so c
this c
problem c
should c
be c
treated c
seriously c
by c
the c
family c
. c

Every c
family c
member c
has c
their c
human c
right c
to c
know c
what c
is c
going c
on c
with c
them c
. c

If c
they c
do c
not c
even c
know c
that c
they c
are c
at c
risk c
for c
a c
genetic c
disorder c
, c
how c
can c
this c
explain i
their c
right c
? c

For c
instance c
, c
John c
is c
informed c
by c
his c
doctor c
that c
he c
is c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
genetic c
disorder c
but c
he c
does c
not c
tell c
his c
sibling c
, c
James c
about c
this c
. c

Although c
telling c
James c
about c
this c
is c
horrible c
to i
some c
extent c
, c
he c
should c
know c
what c
will i
be c
likely c
to c
be i
going c
on c
for c
him c
. c

This c
might c
be c
beneficial c
for c
his c
future c
if c
he c
is c
aware c
of c
the c
risk c
of c
having c
this c
disorder c
. c

The c
next c
point c
is c
that c
telling c
relatives c
can c
raise c
their c
awareness c
of c
having c
the c
similar c
genetic c
disorder c
, c
preventing c
certain c
genetic c
disorders c
to c
affect c
themselves c
. c

Genetic c
disorders c
are c
innate c
, c
but c
the c
great c
improvement c
of c
medical c
treatment c
makes c
it c
possible c
for c
humans c
to c
prevent c
the c
disorder c
or c
to c
reduce c
the c
negative c
effects c
of c
the c
disorder c
on c
themselves c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
doctors c
usually c
quote i
a c
statement i
, c
" c
Prevention c
is c
better c
than c
curation i
" c
; c
this c
gives c
us c
an c
idea c
that c
preventing c
a c
disorder c
to i
happen c
has c
far c
more c
advantages c
than c
curing c
it c
. c

Awareness c
of c
having c
a c
genetic c
disorder c
may c
help c
in c
diagnosing c
a i
genetic c
disorder c
for c
a c
person c
, c
and c
therefore c
, c
this c
may c
make c
the c
prevention c
of c
a c
certain c
disorder c
possible c
. c

For c
example c
, c
hypertension c
is c
partially c
due c
to c
genetic c
factors c
, c
but c
environmental c
factors c
also c
play c
an c
important c
role c
. c

People c
who c
aware i
of c
having c
such c
disorder i
can c
prevent c
the i
disorder c
to i
happen c
by c
adapting c
a c
healthy c
lifestyle c
, c
including c
having c
a c
balanced c
diet c
and c
at c
least c
having i
exercise c
for c
30 c
minutes c
every c
day c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

This i
is c
their c
human c
right c
to c
know c
about c
that c
, c
and c
this c
may c
also c
save c
their c
lives c
by c
preventing c
the c
disorder c
to i
happen i
. c

Together c
with c
the c
advancement c
of c
technology c
over c
past c
decades,medical c
advancement c
has c
increased c
exponentially c
and c
further c
enhancements c
are c
still c
constantly c
upgrading.Empower i
doctors c
with c
advance c
medical c
knowledge,doctors c
are c
able c
to c
diagnose c
and c
undergo i
genetic c
testing c
for c
patients c
to c
help c
them i
prevent c
and i
take c
necessary c
steps c
to c
protect c
their c
life.However c
, c
once c
a c
test c
has c
been c
conducted c
and c
the c
results c
are c
known,a i
question c
of c
disclosing c
the c
results c
to c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
become i
a c
challenging c
issue c
to c
both c
patient c
and c
doctor.In c
my c
opinion,I c
feel i
the c
strong c
urge c
to c
support c
the c
obligation c
to c
inform c
patient i
relatives c
. c

As c
it c
is c
a c
genetic c
risk,the c
patient c
next-of-skin i
might c
have c
a c
high c
chance c
of c
carrying c
the c
risk,hence c
the c
need c
to c
inform c
their i
relatives c
is c
important c
so c
that c
necessary c
prevention i
actions c
could i
be c
taken c
before c
unforeseen c
circumstances c
might c
occur.For c
example,if c
you c
are c
the c
only c
child c
in c
a c
family c
and c
unfortunately,you c
are c
suffering c
from c
a c
genetic c
disease c
that i
the c
genetic c
trait c
might c
be c
passed c
on c
to c
your c
next c
generation c
if c
you c
have c
a c
child,hence i
by c
letting i
your c
family c
members c
aware c
of c
the c
situation,it c
would i
lessen c
family c
stresses i
and c
suffering c
on i
forcing c
you c
to c
settle c
down c
and c
have c
children.However c
, c
social c
ethic i
issues c
like c
discrimination c
and c
privacy c
are c
biggest i
concerns c
and i
potential c
barriers c
to c
enforce i
patients c
or c
doctors c
to c
disclose c
information c
to c
patients c
relatives.It i
challenges i
the i
confidentiality c
and c
privacy c
principles.Currently c
, c
under c
the c
Health c
Insurance c
Portability c
and c
Accountability c
Act c
of c
1996 c
( c
HIPAA c
) c
in c
the c
United c
States,there c
is c
no c
legal c
obligation i
requirement c
to c
disclose c
information c
to c
relatives,it i
is c
up c
to c
the c
patient c
's c
wish c
to i
disclose c
to c
their c
family c
members.Early c
disclosement c
to c
family c
members c
brings c
in c
positive i
reaction c
and c
prevention,as i
in c
the c
case c
of c
Angelina c
Jolie,she i
chose c
to c
disclose c
information c
and c
underwent c
treatment c
to c
reduce c
the c
risk c
of c
breast c
cancer c
significantly c
to c
under c
five c
percent.I c
still i
can c
recall c
her c
reason c
for c
disclosing c
her c
own c
story c
was i
that c
she c
does i
not c
want c
to c
live c
under c
the c
shadow c
of c
cancer c
. c

However,there c
are c
still c
people c
against c
the c
decision c
of c
revealing c
private c
information.As c
in c
the c
case c
of c
Alzheimer c
patients,it c
is c
up c
to c
the c
patient c
's c
own c
choice c
to c
disclose c
information.However,research c
has c
shown c
that c
doctors c
have c
tried c
to c
interpret c
who,how i
and c
whom i
will i
Alzheimer c
disease c
be c
disclosed c
to c
minimise c
potential i
negative c
impact c
to c
families i
members c
( c
DementiaToday,2012 c
) c
.There c
are c
associations c
provide i
helps i
to c
Alzheimer c
patients c
like c
Alzheimer i
's c
Association c
( c
Alzheimer c
's c
Association,1980 c
) c
.Although i
there c
are c
still c
thousand i
of c
genetic i
risk c
diseases c
out c
there c
that c
might c
not c
be c
receiving c
all i
helps i
and c
supports i
from c
everyone,the i
needs i
to c
receive c
immediate c
understanding c
and c
support c
from c
family c
members c
is c
an i
utmost c
help c
that c
patients c
need c
in c
their c
difficult c
time c
. c

In c
conclusion,the c
state c
should c
have i
passed c
a c
legal c
bill c
to c
measure i
and c
provide c
information c
to c
doctors c
that i
till c
which c
extend c
should c
a c
doctor c
opt c
to i
reveal c
to i
relatives c
members i
about c
the c
genetic c
disease c
and c
in c
which c
situations c
it c
is c
open c
to c
patient i
's c
decision.In c
addition,the c
state c
could c
also c
encourage c
to c
create c
assistance c
schemes c
to c
aid i
necessary c
help c
to c
needy c
patients c
to c
encourage c
them c
to c
open c
up c
for i
the i
benefit c
of i
own c
and c
family i
members.Although c
it i
may c
face i
challenges c
from c
social c
ethic i
issues,in c
a i
long c
term,with c
appropriate c
encouragement c
and c
aid c
from c
the c
government,more c
individuals c
would c
have c
a c
different c
view c
of c
acceptance c
and c
take c
appropriate c
measurements c
to c
protect c
their c
own c
health c
and c
their c
loved c
ones c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
the i
study c
in c
the c
genetic i
field c
has c
gone i
further c
and c
further c
due c
to c
the c
high-velocity i
technological i
advancement c
. c

Not c
long c
ago c
, c
the c
human c
genome c
project c
sponsored c
by c
several c
large c
multinational c
corporations c
( c
MNCs c
) c
has i
been c
started c
. c

In c
comparison i
, c
in c
the c
field c
of c
genetic c
testing c
which i
enables c
people c
to i
be c
aware c
of c
the c
risk c
of c
a c
possible c
genetic c
disorder c
, c
as c
the c
technology c
has i
been c
very c
mature i
already c
, i
an i
even c
more c
popular c
topic c
arises c
. c

While c
most c
people c
agree c
that c
each c
individual c
has c
his c
own i
right c
to c
decide c
whether c
to c
undergo c
a c
genetic c
test c
or c
not c
, c
they c
have c
different c
stands c
in i
whether c
it c
is c
the c
patient c
's c
responsibility c
or i
freedom c
to c
share c
the c
result c
with c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
the c
patients c
, c
which i
are c
carriers c
of c
some c
known c
genetic c
risk c
are c
supposed i
to c
share c
the c
truth c
with c
their c
family c
members c
. c

Admittedly i
, c
it i
is c
a c
social c
obligation c
to c
be c
responsible c
for c
the c
life i
of c
other c
people c
. c

To i
the c
whole c
society c
, c
it c
is c
a c
duty c
. c

Take c
H1N1 c
as c
an c
example c
, c
all c
the c
people c
in c
Singapore c
including c
students c
at c
school c
, c
travelers c
at c
the c
Changi c
Airport c
, c
workers c
in c
the c
office c
as c
well c
as c
passengers c
on c
the c
street c
are i
forced c
by c
law c
to c
take c
their c
temperature c
and c
report c
the c
result c
to c
the c
relevant c
government c
authority c
in c
charge c
. c

To c
those c
family c
members c
who c
care c
about c
them c
, c
it c
is c
also c
a c
moral c
obligation c
. c

How c
can c
they c
not c
tell c
their c
loved c
ones c
who c
they c
really c
are c
and c
get i
their c
loved c
ones c
in c
danger c
? c

The c
basis c
of c
a c
family c
is c
that c
everyone c
trusts c
and c
love i
each c
other c
with c
no c
doubts c
. c

Without c
trust c
and c
love c
, c
there c
is c
no c
difference c
between c
a c
family c
and c
a c
bunch c
of c
strangers c
living c
together c
. c

Hence c
, c
it c
is c
essential c
to c
tell c
their i
family c
members c
about c
the c
risk c
of c
their i
genetic c
disorder c
both c
as c
a c
social c
responsibility c
and c
a i
favor c
to c
conserve c
the c
family c
basis c
. c

Moreover c
, c
telling c
their c
family c
members c
the c
truth c
is c
the c
fastest c
and c
easiest c
way c
to c
get c
their c
support c
. c

Without c
the c
support c
of c
loved c
ones c
, c
patients c
' c
life i
is i
no c
better c
than c
death c
. c

Family c
members c
, i
as i
one c
the i
closest c
group i
of c
people c
from c
whom c
they i
can c
get c
comfort c
, i
is c
a c
crucial c
factor c
for c
them c
to c
successfully c
get c
over c
any c
possible c
troubles c
as c
a c
result c
of c
genetic c
disorder c
. c

A c
study c
of c
New c
York c
University c
in c
2010 c
shown i
that c
patients c
with c
family c
members c
around c
generally c
recovers i
2-4 c
days c
faster c
than c
those c
taken c
care c
by i
professional c
nurses c
. c

Even c
for c
those c
patients c
with c
terminal c
diseases c
, c
the c
duration c
of c
their c
survival c
is c
30 c
% c
longer c
due c
to c
the c
family c
support c
. c

Some c
people c
may c
say c
that c
telling c
the c
truth c
may c
arise i
some c
unnecessary c
doubts c
and c
panics i
which c
will c
endanger c
the i
family c
harmony c
. c

While i
every c
family c
need i
to c
go c
through c
this c
or i
that c
kind c
of c
troublesome c
situations i
, i
the i
more c
troubles c
that c
a c
family c
has c
gone c
through c
together c
, c
the c
greater c
bond i
will i
be c
established c
between c
the c
family c
members c
as c
well c
as c
the c
greater c
amount i
of c
trust c
, c
love c
and c
understanding c
. c

Hence c
, c
for c
a c
family c
in c
which c
every c
member c
is c
truly c
believing c
in c
each c
other c
and c
loving c
each c
other c
,all c
these c
troubles c
are c
just c
testaments c
to c
make c
them c
stronger c
. c

Just i
as c
the c
lyrics c
of c
Kelly c
Clarkson c
, c
what c
does c
n't c
kill c
you c
make i
you c
stronger c
. c

Being c
in c
Asian i
society c
where c
genetic c
testing c
is c
not c
a c
common c
practice c
, c
I c
do c
think c
that c
it c
is c
the c
choice c
of c
the c
patient c
whether c
he c
or c
she c
wants c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
his c
or c
her c
disease c
. c

The c
courage c
to c
take c
the c
genetic c
testing i
and c
yet c
to c
inform c
their c
relatives c
about c
the c
risk c
that c
they c
may c
have c
may i
result c
in c
people c
being c
judgmental c
while c
actually c
it c
is c
just c
a c
risk c
and c
not c
a c
confirmed c
case c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
since c
it c
is c
the c
person c
's c
gene c
that c
is c
affected c
, c
he c
has c
the c
right c
to c
determine c
with c
whom c
he c
wants c
to c
share c
the c
information c
with i
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
while c
I c
fell i
that c
a c
carrier c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
the c
genetic c
risk c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
suggest c
the i
person c
to c
at c
least c
share c
the c
information c
with c
her c
or c
his c
potential c
partner c
( c
husband c
or c
wife c
) c
since c
the c
individual c
's c
genetic c
risk c
may c
affect c
their c
future c
children c
. c

Many c
people c
in c
our c
society c
are c
not c
well c
informed c
about c
many c
genetic c
diseases c
and c
many c
of c
them c
will c
most c
likely c
to i
judge c
or c
at c
least c
differentiate i
those c
who c
have c
genetic c
diseases c
since c
they c
feel c
that c
the c
patients c
are c
abnormal c
or c
'weird' c
. c

This c
is c
because c
many c
relate c
genetic c
diseases c
to c
those c
such c
as c
Bubble-Boy c
disease c
, c
autism c
or c
down-syndrome c
. c

In c
those c
diseases c
, c
many c
who c
are c
affected c
do c
actually c
have c
different c
physical c
characteristics c
compared c
to c
those c
without c
the c
genetic c
diseases c
. c

While c
we c
do c
know c
that c
we c
should c
not c
discriminate c
them i
based c
on c
their c
limitations c
, c
many c
people c
still c
do c
it c
with c
or c
without c
them i
realizing c
it c
. c

In c
this c
particular c
case c
, c
we c
are c
discussing c
about i
whether c
a c
person c
should c
tell c
his c
relatives c
about c
him c
having c
a c
RISK i
of c
a c
particular c
genetic c
disease c
. c

It c
is c
normal c
for c
people c
to c
demand c
for i
a c
fair c
and c
similar c
treatment c
as i
the c
others c
and c
therefore c
it c
is c
normal c
for c
people c
to c
try c
to c
keep c
some c
of c
their c
secrets c
or c
personal c
issues c
to c
themselves c
in c
case c
some c
people c
judge c
them c
or c
treat c
them c
differently.Many c
people c
really c
love c
to c
hear c
what c
they c
want c
to c
hear c
and c
therefore c
they c
may c
just c
ignore c
the c
word c
'risk c
' c
and c
assume c
that c
the c
person c
has i
suffered c
from c
the c
disease c
. c

To c
prevent c
that c
from c
happening c
, c
I c
do c
feel c
that c
it c
is c
up c
to c
the c
person c
whether c
he c
wants c
to c
share c
the c
information c
with c
his c
family c
since c
his c
family c
may c
either c
be i
paranoid c
or c
judge c
him c
and c
act c
differently c
. c

Especially c
when c
it c
is c
just c
a c
risk c
, i
the c
option c
is c
really c
his c
since c
he c
is c
not c
an c
actual c
sufferer c
. c

There c
may c
be c
some c
people c
who c
say c
that c
it c
is c
necessary c
to c
tell c
the c
family c
members c
about c
the c
risk c
since c
some c
of c
them c
may c
be c
affected c
, c
while c
I c
do c
think c
that c
this c
view c
has c
a c
point c
, c
how c
much c
you c
can c
trust c
your c
family c
regarding c
this c
issue c
may c
also c
be c
a c
case c
. c

May c
be c
we c
can c
trust c
our c
immediate c
family c
members c
but c
can c
we c
really c
trust c
all c
the c
other c
relatives c
? c

Furthermore c
, c
since c
the c
genetic c
risk c
or c
genetic c
disease c
is c
a c
very c
personal c
case c
, c
it c
is c
up c
to c
the c
person c
's c
call c
to c
tell c
the c
relatives c
about c
it c
. c

However c
, c
as c
I c
said c
earlier c
, c
it c
is c
better c
for c
the c
person c
to c
at c
least c
tell c
about c
the c
potential c
risk c
to c
his c
or c
her c
future c
partner c
since c
his c
genetic c
risk c
may c
affect c
his c
children c
later c
. c

This c
information c
needs c
to c
be c
at c
least c
acknowledged c
by c
the c
other c
party c
before c
they c
make c
the c
decision c
to c
get c
married c
and c
have c
children c
. c

There c
may c
be c
possibilities c
when c
both c
the c
husband c
and c
wife c
are c
carriers c
and c
therefore c
they c
should c
not c
have c
any c
child c
since c
their c
child c
may c
not c
be c
able c
to c
survive c
even i
after c
they c
are c
born c
. c

Or c
in c
a c
less c
extreme c
case c
, c
the c
child c
may c
be c
disabled c
. c

This c
piece c
of c
information c
does c
play c
a c
role c
in c
family c
planning c
matters c
, c
therefore c
although c
no c
one c
is c
obliged c
to c
tell c
about c
their c
genetic c
risk c
to c
anyone c
, c
it c
should c
be c
encouraged c
to c
tell i
it c
to c
their c
future c
partner c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
whether c
or c
not c
the c
carrier c
wants c
to c
tell c
his c
relatives c
regarding c
his c
genetic c
risk c
, c
the c
choice c
is c
his c
because c
it c
is c
his c
own c
gene c
and c
he c
has c
the c
full c
right i
of i
it c
. c

He c
may c
have c
different c
considerations c
other i
than c
due c
to c
the c
judging c
people c
or c
may c
result i
in c
making c
his c
family c
worry c
for c
nothing c
when c
thinking c
of c
whether c
he c
should c
tell c
it c
to c
his c
relatives c
, c
and c
no c
matter c
what c
choice c
he c
makes c
, c
we c
need c
to c
respect c
it c
and c
we c
have c
no c
right c
in c
saying c
that c
he c
must c
tell c
his c
relatives c
about c
it c
. c

We c
all c
know c
that c
life c
is c
priceless c
and c
we c
have c
no c
right c
to c
judge c
a c
person c
's c
death c
. c

With c
the c
improvements c
of c
technology c
, c
a c
new c
life c
with c
genetic c
risk c
can c
be c
detected c
. c

Genetic c
refers i
the i
chance c
of c
inheriting c
a c
disorder c
or c
disease c
. c

Therefore c
an c
entirely c
new c
dilemma c
is c
born c
: c
should c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
? c

This c
essay c
will c
discuss c
the c
reasons c
why c
the c
relatives c
are i
obligated c
to c
be c
informed c
that c
their c
children c
have c
genetic c
risk c
. c

One c
of c
the c
reasons c
that c
the c
parents c
should c
be c
informed c
is c
that c
they c
have c
to c
decide c
whether c
they c
are c
capable c
to c
raise c
a c
child c
with c
genetic c
risk c
. c

The c
child c
with c
genetic c
risk c
may c
not c
have c
the c
ability c
to c
work c
, c
to c
build i
up c
the i
family c
with i
the i
others c
and c
most c
of c
the c
time c
they c
are c
not c
acceptable i
for i
the c
majority c
. c

They c
may c
not c
able i
to c
enjoy c
a i
normal c
people i
can i
enjoy c
. c

This c
competitive c
world c
is c
cruel c
to c
those c
are c
not c
able c
to c
survive c
. c

Parents c
and c
relatives c
have c
to c
work c
longer c
than c
expected c
and c
endlessly c
to c
foster c
their c
child c
if c
he/she c
is c
not c
able c
to c
foster i
himself/herself c
. c

The c
situation c
may c
become c
worst i
if c
the c
child c
has c
diseases c
like c
cancer c
or c
heart c
disease c
, c
which c
means c
that c
parents c
have c
another c
heavy c
baggage c
named i
medication c
fees c
. c

Not c
only c
the c
child c
but c
also c
the c
entirely c
family c
will c
suffer c
. c

It c
is c
still c
early c
for c
parents c
to c
decide c
whether c
they c
can c
foster c
a c
new c
life c
that c
are i
not c
able c
to c
work c
and c
may c
suffer c
the i
pain c
in i
the i
entire c
life c
. c

The c
other c
reason c
that c
parents c
should c
know c
the c
baby c
they c
have c
is c
a c
carrier c
of c
genetic c
risk c
is c
for c
a c
nation c
's c
good c
. c

There c
are c
always c
newspaper c
report i
that c
a c
new c
born c
baby c
has c
be c
abandoned c
at c
hospital c
after c
they c
realized c
the c
baby c
have i
diseases c
that c
need c
a c
huge c
amount c
of c
money c
to c
secure c
. c

For c
the i
countries c
like c
Singapore c
, i
they c
are c
short c
of c
manpower c
to c
contribute c
to c
the c
nation c
. c

However c
, c
every c
year c
the c
government c
has c
to c
spend c
a c
lot c
to c
help c
the c
disables i
such c
as c
medical c
subsidizes c
and c
builds i
up i
special c
schools c
to c
educate c
them c
. c

Without c
increasing c
number i
of c
disables i
in c
a c
nation c
, c
the c
government c
is c
able c
to c
concentrate c
to c
develop c
in c
other c
ways i
like c
military i
and c
education c
. c

As c
citizens c
of c
a c
nation c
, c
they c
have c
the c
responsibility c
to c
support c
their c
country c
in c
many c
ways c
. c

Moreover c
, c
in c
the c
world c
we c
are c
living c
today c
, c
many c
miscarriages c
conducted i
in c
hospital c
every c
day c
. c

It c
is c
easier c
for c
people c
to c
accept c
it c
morally c
. c

Therefore c
I c
believe c
the c
parents c
have c
their i
right c
to c
know c
the c
healthiness i
of c
their c
child c
. c

Many c
people c
may c
support c
with i
a c
theory c
that c
every c
people i
have i
their i
right c
to c
enjoy c
the c
world c
, c
especially c
people c
with c
religions c
. c

However c
, c
the c
problem c
is c
, c
will c
the c
people c
really c
enjoy c
their c
life c
if c
they c
have c
to c
stay c
at c
hospital c
everyday c
and c
with c
all c
the c
needles c
and c
endless c
pain c
? c

Parents c
know c
what c
the c
best c
is c
for c
their c
children c
, c
thus c
they c
will c
make c
a i
right c
decision c
after c
they c
have c
be i
informed c
. c

Also c
, c
human c
being i
should c
improve c
the c
medical c
field c
in c
order c
to c
prevent c
the c
tragedy c
happen i
. c

I c
think c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

Genetic c
testing c
is c
a c
personal c
choice c
. c

One c
should c
have c
the c
full c
control c
of c
his/her c
information c
and c
it c
is c
his/her c
right c
to c
decide c
whether c
or c
not c
to c
disclose c
it c
to c
some c
one c
else c
. c

As c
far c
as c
I c
am c
concerned c
, c
when c
a c
couple c
are c
going c
to c
have c
babies c
, c
they c
are c
going c
to c
run c
a c
few c
tests c
and c
see c
whether c
their i
could c
have i
some c
genetic c
diseases c
. c

The c
results c
are c
disclosed c
to c
husbands c
and c
wifes c
. c

This c
is c
not c
the c
case c
I c
am c
talking c
about c
here c
. c

The c
most c
obvious c
reason c
for c
those c
who c
argue c
for c
this c
opinion c
is c
that c
the c
relatives c
of c
the c
carrier c
are c
at c
high c
risk c
of c
carrying c
these c
diseases c
. c

They c
have c
the c
right c
to c
know c
whether c
they c
are c
at c
risk c
. c

Also c
, c
telling c
them c
the c
result c
can c
let c
them c
largely c
reduce c
the c
cost c
for c
multiple c
testing c
. c

They c
can c
also c
take c
immediate c
measures c
to c
reduce c
the c
possibility c
of c
having c
this c
disease c
. c

If c
person i
has c
a c
disease c
C c
that c
might c
be c
a c
result c
of c
gene c
A c
. c

He c
runs c
a c
test c
and c
know i
that c
he c
has c
the c
gene c
AA c
. c

This c
means c
both c
of c
his c
parents c
has i
gene c
A c
and c
they c
are c
both c
under c
high c
risk c
of c
having c
disease c
C. c
They c
could c
save c
the c
cost c
of c
runing i
two c
separate c
tests c
to c
see c
whether c
they c
are c
under c
high c
risk c
of c
having c
disease c
C. c
If c
he c
runs c
a c
test c
and c
know i
that c
he c
has c
the c
gene c
Aa c
. i

This i
means c
one c
of c
his c
parents c
has c
gene c
A c
and c
one c
cost c
of c
testing c
could c
be c
saved c
. c

His c
relatives c
can c
then c
take c
measures c
, c
if c
this c
disease c
can c
some i
how c
be c
prevented c
, c
to c
stop c
this c
disease c
from c
taking c
their c
lives c
. c

However c
, c
this c
can c
also c
be c
achieved c
from c
personal c
choice c
. c

One c
can c
choose c
to c
tell c
their c
relatives c
if c
they c
are c
at c
risk c
. c

Most c
people c
care c
about c
their c
relatives c
, i
if c
there c
is c
no c
serious c
consequence c
of c
telling c
them c
so c
, c
I c
assume c
most c
of c
them c
will c
tell c
their c
relatives c
to c
be c
careful c
. c

One c
might c
also c
choose c
to c
hint c
or c
encourage c
their c
certain i
relatives c
to c
run c
a c
gene c
test c
if c
they c
are c
concerned c
about c
negative c
consequences c
that c
comes i
across c
when c
they c
disclose c
their c
genetic c
results c
. c

There c
are c
possible c
negative c
consequences c
that c
those c
might c
face c
if c
they c
disclose c
their c
genetic c
results c
to c
their c
relative c
. c

If c
a c
person c
is c
obliged c
to c
tell c
his/her c
relatives c
, c
he c
or c
she c
might c
be c
discriminated c
by i
those c
who c
do c
not c
carry c
this c
gene c
. c

He c
or c
she c
might c
even c
be c
adviced i
not c
to c
get c
married c
or c
have c
children c
. c

For c
example c
, c
if c
an c
unmarried c
person c
has c
gene c
Aa c
and c
gene c
aa c
is c
sufficient c
for c
a c
very c
seriou i
disease c
. i

After i
he c
takes c
the c
test c
and i
be i
obliged c
to c
tell c
his c
relatives c
, i
everyone c
know i
that c
he c
is c
a c
carrier c
. c

So c
all c
the c
married c
couples c
go c
run c
a c
test c
and c
know c
they c
are c
not c
carriers.They c
might c
subconsiously c
see c
him c
as c
different c
and c
worry c
that c
he c
will c
find c
a c
wife c
who c
will c
carry c
this c
gene c
as c
well c
. c

Third c
, c
it c
is c
hard c
to c
define c
relatives c
. c

If c
a c
gene c
runs c
in c
the c
family c
, c
one c
of c
the c
family c
member i
test i
positive c
, i
whom i
does c
he c
need c
to c
tell c
. c

If c
that c
is c
a c
big c
family c
, c
is c
he c
obliged c
to c
tell c
everyone c
? c

Spouses c
usually c
have c
very c
close c
relationships c
, i
if i
person c
A c
tell i
his c
family c
that c
he c
has c
this c
gene c
, c
his c
uncle c
C c
knows c
and c
tells c
his c
wife c
D c
that c
he c
needed c
to c
run c
a c
test c
because c
his c
cousine i
has c
this c
disease c
. c

However c
wife c
D c
is c
not c
even c
under c
the c
risk c
of c
having c
this c
disease c
. c

Then c
wife c
D c
might c
tell c
her c
mother c
, c
who c
likes c
to c
gossip c
on c
her c
way c
to c
the c
theatre c
. c

In c
less c
than c
a c
week c
half i
of c
the c
town c
knows c
person c
A c
has c
a c
risked i
gene c
, c
and c
his c
family c
might c
be i
a c
genetically i
risked i
family i
. c

Then c
nobody c
wants c
to c
marry c
A c
, c
or c
his c
relatives c
. c

This c
is c
the c
potential c
consequence c
if c
one c
does c
not c
have c
full c
control c
of c
his/her c
information c
, c
especially c
when c
the c
party c
that c
he c
is c
obliged c
to c
disclose c
his c
information c
to c
is c
a c
potentially c
large c
group c
( c
relatives c
) c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c

Carrier i
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c

Nowadays c
, c
people c
not c
only c
pursuit i
the c
comfort c
of c
their c
own c
life c
but c
also c
a c
better c
development c
of c
their c
following c
generations c
. c

Since c
the c
technology c
of c
modern c
society c
has c
been i
so c
advanced c
, c
it c
becomes c
possible c
for c
people c
to c
make c
decision i
to c
take c
genetic c
test i
so c
as c
to c
be c
clear c
whether c
or c
not c
they c
carry c
genetic c
risk c
which i
can c
affect c
their c
next c
generation c
. c

The c
debatable c
question c
, c
an c
ethical c
dilemma c
, c
is c
that i
are c
people c
responsible c
for c
telling c
their c
relatives c
that c
they c
carry c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
? c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
the c
responsibility c
of c
telling c
family c
and c
relatives c
is c
quite c
obvious c
. c

And c
there c
are c
two c
basic c
reasons c
. c

The c
first c
one c
is c
the c
importance c
of c
being c
responsible c
for c
your c
self-wellness c
and c
health c
of c
your c
relatives c
and c
the c
second c
one c
is c
being c
responsible c
for c
the c
next c
generations c
. c

The c
awareness c
of c
your c
relatives c
and c
families c
about c
your c
genetic c
risk c
is c
good c
for c
your c
self-wellness c
and c
health c
of c
your c
relatives c
. c

Because i
if c
you c
are c
carrying c
that c
genetic c
risk c
, c
then i
there c
is c
great i
possibility c
that c
your c
relatives c
like c
parents c
or c
siblings c
are c
carrying c
the c
same c
genetic c
risk c
as c
well c
. c

The c
genetic c
risk c
that c
you c
carry c
may c
or c
may c
not c
affect c
your c
health c
and c
put c
you c
in c
danger c
. c

If c
you c
have c
n't c
undergone c
the c
genetic c
testing c
, c
it c
's c
just c
odd i
and c
fate c
for i
what c
will c
happen c
to c
both c
of i
you c
and c
your c
relatives c
. c

However c
, c
if c
you c
have c
undergone c
and i
known i
that c
you c
are c
a c
carrier c
, c
you c
are c
responsible c
for c
your c
whole c
family c
. c

Even c
though c
you c
can c
not c
eliminate c
the c
risk c
completely c
, c
you c
can c
at c
least c
try c
to c
be c
alert c
to c
avoiding c
getting c
the c
disease c
. c

As c
for c
those c
in c
your c
family c
who c
are c
more c
likely c
to c
be c
affected c
, c
they c
can c
go c
to c
the c
hospital c
to c
do c
the c
checks c
regularly c
. c

Therefore c
, c
telling c
the c
families c
and c
the c
relatives c
to c
get c
prepared c
for i
fighting c
the c
disease c
and c
even c
prevent c
to i
get c
the c
disease c
is c
your c
responsibility c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
you c
are c
also c
being i
responsible c
for c
your c
next c
generations c
by c
telling c
the c
truth c
that c
you c
are c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
genetic c
risk c
. c

If c
your c
wife c
is c
not c
aware c
of c
the c
truth c
and c
give i
birth c
to i
the c
baby c
, c
it c
will c
be c
possible c
for c
your c
child c
to c
carry c
the c
same c
genetic c
risk c
as c
well c
. c

Being c
the c
parent c
, c
you c
are c
not i
responsible c
to c
you i
next c
generations i
, c
since c
you c
allow c
the c
genetic c
risk c
to c
be c
passed c
on c
by c
generation c
and c
generation c
and c
being i
aware c
of c
it c
. c

However c
, c
if c
you c
tell c
the c
truth c
to c
your c
wife c
and c
relatives c
, c
you c
offer c
a c
chance i
about c
whether c
to c
have c
child i
or c
not c
. c

And c
if c
you c
still c
decide c
to c
have c
the c
baby c
, c
since c
the c
technology c
has c
been c
developed c
so i
advanced c
, c
it c
might c
be c
possible c
in c
the c
future c
that c
the c
application c
of c
altering c
gene i
is c
perfected c
and c
widely c
used c
, i
you i
can c
then c
choose c
to c
give c
birth c
to c
babies c
by c
giving c
them c
a c
brighter c
future c
. c

This c
is c
the c
responsibility c
of c
being c
a c
parent c
. c

And c
in c
my c
opinion c
, c
this c
seems c
to c
be c
the c
main c
purpose c
of c
undergoing c
that c
genetic c
testing c
at i
the c
first c
place c
. c

As c
a c
conclusion c
, c
once c
you c
have c
undergone c
the c
genetic c
testing c
and c
being i
aware c
of c
carrying c
some c
specific c
genetic c
risk c
, c
there c
are c
responsibilities c
to c
your c
relatives c
, c
yourself c
, c
and c
your c
following c
generations c
by c
telling c
your c
relatives c
and c
families c
the c
truth c
. c

To c
tell c
or c
not c
to c
tell c

Consider c
a c
case c
, i
we c
decide c
to c
undergo c
genetic c
testing c
and c
have i
known c
the c
result c
of c
it c
. i

We i
found i
that c
we c
actually c
are c
the i
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
. c

Then c
it c
becomes c
troublesome c
about c
whether c
we c
need c
to c
tell c
our c
relatives c
who c
may c
carry c
this c
genetic c
risk c
as c
well c
. c

There c
are c
really c
a c
lot c
of c
things c
we c
need c
to c
consider c
. c

Every c
choice c
we c
have i
made c
may c
have c
a c
huge c
impact c
on c
their c
whole c
life i
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
what c
should c
we c
do c
? c

Tell c
them c
or c
keep c
this c
secret c
until c
we c
die c
? c

Many c
people c
feel c
that c
we c
should c
tell c
our c
relatives c
since c
we c
really c
care c
about c
their c
health c
status c
. c

For c
example c
, c
diabetes c
is c
a c
kind c
of c
genetic c
disease c
. c

Once c
we c
found i
we c
were i
carrying c
this c
genetic c
risk c
, c
it c
is c
better c
for c
us c
to c
tell c
our c
family c
members c
because c
they c
may c
carry c
it c
as c
well c
. c

If c
we c
tell c
them c
, c
they c
may c
start c
paying c
more c
attention c
to c
their c
daily c
habits c
like c
eating c
less c
sugar c
contained c
food c
and c
keeping c
a c
good c
mood c
. c

And c
it c
is c
important c
for c
those i
young c
people c
. c

The c
earlier c
we c
tell c
them c
, c
a i
better c
habit c
they c
will c
arise c
and c
better c
for c
the c
rest c
of c
their c
lives c
. c

What c
's c
more c
they c
may c
undergo c
genetic c
test i
as c
well c
to c
see c
whether c
they c
are c
carrying c
it i
or c
not c
which c
is c
also c
better c
for c
them c
. c

However c
, c
some c
people c
may c
argue c
that i
why c
we i
want c
to c
interfere c
with c
their c
lives c
? c

Sometimes c
it c
becomes c
extremely c
hard c
for c
them c
to c
accept c
this c
news c
especially c
if c
they c
are c
going c
to c
know c
that c
they c
or c
their c
descendants c
may c
have c
a c
severe c
disease c
like c
blood c
disease c
which c
is c
untreatable c
. c

Imagine c
you c
are c
living c
like c
a c
normal c
person c
but c
suddenly c
one c
day c
your c
relative c
comes i
tells c
you c
that c
actually c
there c
are c
some c
possibilities c
that c
you c
may c
encounter c
some c
disease c
in c
the c
future c
, i
what c
kind c
of c
feeling c
are c
you c
going c
to c
have c
? c

It c
may c
affect c
our c
daily c
lives c
and c
we c
will c
think c
about c
it c
every c
day c
. c

We c
become c
so c
anxious c
that c
we c
can c
not c
focus c
on c
everything i
. c

At c
the c
same c
time c
, c
there c
will c
also c
be c
chances c
that c
the c
genetic c
test c
result c
is c
not c
correct c
which c
means c
they c
are c
actually c
wasting c
their c
lives c
worrying c
about c
this c
thing c
, c
so c
actually c
we c
are c
bringing c
trouble c
to c
them c
. c

Personally c
I c
feel c
that c
we c
still c
should c
take c
our i
responsibility c
to c
tell c
them c
the c
situation c
. c

Since c
this c
will c
really c
affect c
their c
lives c
, c
what c
we c
should c
do c
is c
to c
try c
to c
make i
it c
in c
a c
positive c
way c
. c

We c
can c
not c
let c
it c
go c
. c

We c
should c
know c
that c
although c
we c
may c
affect c
their c
lives c
, c
we c
can c
still c
let c
them c
make c
correct c
choices c
in c
the c
future c
. c

It c
is c
only c
after c
we c
tell c
them c
will i
they c
start c
paying c
attention c
to c
their c
health c
. c

They c
will c
consider c
whether c
to c
give i
a c
birth c
to c
a c
new c
baby c
because c
of c
this c
genetic c
problem c
and c
they c
will c
start c
finding c
ways c
to c
try c
to c
avoid c
their c
baby c
to i
carry c
this c
genetic c
risk c
as c
well c
. c

They c
always c
have c
a c
choice c
about c
whether c
to c
undergo c
the c
genetic c
test c
or c
not c
. c

Maybe c
after c
we c
tell c
them c
, c
they c
will c
go c
for c
it c
and c
know c
more c
about c
themselves c
. c

I c
know c
it c
will c
have c
a c
huge c
impact c
on c
them c
, c
but c
we c
should c
know c
that c
they c
are c
our c
loved c
ones c
, i
we c
need c
to c
tell c
them c
and c
help c
them c
. c

A c
genetic c
risk c
carrier c
should c
be c
obliged c
to c
tell c

Genetic c
testing c
will i
be c
conducted c
when c
the c
individual c
is c
at c
risk c
of c
some c
possible c
disease c
. c

Once c
the c
test c
is c
done c
, c
whether c
the c
results c
should c
be c
open c
to c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
has c
caused c
social i
extensive c
controversy c
. c

Some c
say c
it c
is c
a c
kind c
of c
invasion c
of c
privacy c
for c
the c
carrier c
and c
should c
be c
protected c
. c

He c
or c
she c
has c
the c
right c
not c
to c
tell c
anyone c
. c

However c
, c
in c
my c
opinion c
, c
it c
is c
the c
obligation c
of c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
about c
his c
or c
her c
actual c
situation c
. c

This c
essay c
will c
illustrate c
in i
two c
aspects i
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
it c
can c
be c
an i
alert c
for c
the c
family c
members c
of c
the c
patient c
and c
let i
them c
be i
aware c
of c
the c
possible c
disease c
that c
they c
may c
also c
have c
. c

As c
we c
all c
know c
, c
genetic c
risk c
carriers c
are c
likely c
to c
pass c
the c
genetics c
to c
their c
family c
members c
. c

Once c
one c
person c
in c
the c
family c
is c
found c
to c
be c
carrying c
risky c
genetic i
, c
other c
members c
in c
his c
or c
her c
family c
may c
also c
have c
the c
risk c
of c
disease c
. c

Some c
of c
the c
diseases c
may c
not c
show c
symptoms c
until c
the c
carrier c
is c
old c
enough c
. c

Therefore c
, c
telling c
the c
relatives c
about c
the c
situation c
may c
avoid c
a c
lot c
of c
trouble c
in c
this c
way c
and c
save c
much c
time c
for c
proper c
treatment c
. c

Sometimes c
life c
may c
even c
be c
saved c
if c
they c
are c
told c
early c
and c
conduct c
timely c
treatment c
. c

So c
for c
the c
consideration c
for i
the c
other c
family c
members c
, c
the c
relatives c
should c
be c
informed c
. c

Secondly c
, c
it c
can c
avoid c
genetic c
disease c
passed c
to c
the c
next c
generation c
when c
they c
intend c
to c
have c
babies c
. c

They c
should c
let c
their c
spouse c
know c
about c
his c
or c
her c
situation c
before c
marriage c
. c

They c
need c
to c
ask c
for c
doctor i
's c
advice c
before c
they c
plan c
to c
have c
a c
baby c
. c

Some c
genetic i
gene c
will c
pass c
only c
to c
boys c
rather c
than c
girls c
, c
some c
are c
on i
the c
contrary c
. c

If c
the c
carrier c
refuses c
to c
tell c
the c
truth c
to c
his c
or c
her c
spouse c
, c
another c
life c
may c
have c
risk c
of c
inheriting c
the c
genetic c
disease c
. c

I c
noticed c
a c
real c
story c
on i
newspaper i
years c
ago c
. c

A c
couple c
in c
China c
have i
a c
son c
of c
5 c
years c
old c
. c

Their c
son c
unfortunately c
fell c
ill c
and c
he c
was c
diagnosis i
a c
kind c
of c
genetic c
disease c
which c
is c
very c
serious c
. c

They c
were c
told c
that c
the c
wife c
's c
family c
was c
carrying c
the c
polygenetic c
disorder c
and c
can i
pass c
only c
to c
boys c
rather c
than c
girls c
. c

Therefore c
their c
son c
was i
inherited c
the c
genetic c
disease c
. c

However c
, c
the c
wife c
actually c
had c
already i
known c
about c
the c
polygenetic c
disorder c
before c
the c
marriage c
and c
she c
did c
not c
tell c
her c
husband c
. c

The c
son c
was i
died c
after c
one c
year c
's c
treatment c
and c
the c
couple c
got c
divorced c
later c
after c
that c
. c

If c
the c
wife c
had c
not c
hind i
the c
truth c
and c
asked c
for c
doctor i
's c
advice c
before c
they c
have i
baby c
, c
the c
tragic i
would c
not c
happen i
. c

In c
a c
nutshell c
, c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
has c
the c
responsibility c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
. c

On i
the c
one c
hand c
, c
it c
can c
tell c
members c
of c
the c
carrier c
's c
family c
the c
possible c
disease c
they c
may c
have c
and c
can i
perform i
treatment c
in c
time c
if c
possible c
. c

On i
the c
other c
hand c
, c
it c
may c
pass c
the c
disease c
to c
the c
next c
generation c
if c
the c
carrier c
hides c
the c
truth c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
with c
the c
advancement c
of c
technology c
, c
it c
is c
easy c
to c
do c
a i
genetic c
testing c
. c

We c
can c
not c
deny c
that c
the c
genetic c
testing c
really c
helps c
people c
a c
lot c
when c
they c
face c
the i
disorder c
problem c
. c

However c
, c
I c
thought i
that c
the c
genetic c
information c
is c
one c
person c
's c
personal c
privacy c
which c
should c
be c
protected c
by c
the i
law c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
thought i
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
. c

There c
are c
three c
reasons c
as c
follows c
. c

Firstly c
, c
the c
information c
concerning c
to i
the c
genetic c
is i
something c
personally i
which c
is c
also c
a i
privacy i
like c
people c
's c
bank c
card c
key c
. c

Other c
people c
should c
not c
be c
told c
without c
the c
person c
's c
permission c
even c
though c
they c
are c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
. c

The c
government c
should c
set c
the c
law c
to c
protect c
this c
kind c
of c
privacy c
. c

Once c
people c
's c
genetic c
information c
is c
told c
to c
other c
people c
. i

They i
may c
know c
the i
person c
's c
potential c
disabled i
disease c
or i
other c
bad c
things c
naturally c
. c

They c
may c
set c
a c
bias c
on c
this c
person c
even c
abandon c
his i
or c
her c
. c

People c
do c
not c
have c
the c
ability c
to c
choose c
their c
gene c
, c
they c
should c
not c
be c
thought c
badly i
because c
of c
bad i
gene c
. c

So c
I c
think c
whatever c
the c
genetic c
is i
or c
whether c
the c
gene c
is i
match c
with c
their c
parents c
, c
it c
should c
not c
be c
told c
to c
anyone c
even c
his i
or i
her i
family c
or c
relatives c
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
may c
destroy c
the c
peace c
of c
a c
family c
even c
broken i
the c
relation i
between c
children c
with i
the i
adult i
. c

Once c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
know c
that i
the c
person c
does i
not c
have c
the i
relation i
with c
them c
. c

However c
happy c
they c
were c
before c
, c
there c
would c
be c
some c
barrier c
appears i
which c
will i
truly c
destroy c
the c
family c
gradually c
. c

The c
relationship c
between c
the c
parents c
and c
their c
children c
should c
not c
be c
tested c
only i
in c
the c
genetic c
way c
; c
it c
is c
something c
much c
deeper c
and c
tighter i
. c

The c
parents c
give c
knowledge c
and c
love c
to c
the c
children c
, c
meanwhile c
they c
feel c
happy c
with c
the c
accompany i
of c
the c
children c
. c

The c
children c
rely c
the i
parent i
to c
live c
. c

When c
they c
grow c
up c
, c
they c
take c
care c
of c
the c
old c
parents c
and c
thank c
for i
their c
dedication c
. c

The c
relation c
between c
parents c
and c
children c
is c
something c
about c
love c
and c
dedication c
. c

Everyone i
does c
not c
want i
to c
see c
the c
scene c
of c
the i
broken c
family c
due c
to c
the c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
think c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
without c
the c
person c
's c
permission c
. c

Finally c
, c
the c
technology c
of c
testing c
the c
gene c
is c
not c
very c
mature c
now i
. c

There c
also c
exists c
some c
probability c
of c
wrong i
testing c
. c

If c
the c
wrong i
testing c
was i
not c
found c
by c
the c
doctor c
, c
the c
family c
and c
the c
children c
may c
be c
sad c
and c
have c
a c
struggling i
life i
for c
their i
whole c
life c
. c

Therefore c
I c
think c
a c
know i
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
. c

Therefore c
, c
considering c
the i
people c
's c
privacy c
and c
the c
existence c
of c
wrong c
testing c
, c
for c
the c
peace c
of c
the c
family c
, c
I c
support c
that c
a c
know i
genetic c
risk c
should c
not c
be c
obligated c
to c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
family c
or c
relatives c
without c
the c
person c
's c
permission c
. c

A c
Carrier c
of c
a c
Known c
Genetic c
Risk c
Should c
be c
Obligated c
to c
Tell c
His c
or c
Her c
Relatives c

More c
and c
more c
illness i
are c
discovered c
to c
be c
related c
to c
some i
genes c
with c
the c
development c
of c
the c
medical c
technology c
. c

People c
will c
know c
about c
whether c
they c
carry c
a c
disease c
on i
their c
genes c
after c
they c
have c
done c
the c
genetic c
test c
. c

If c
there c
is c
no c
problem c
, c
that c
will c
be c
wonderful c
. c

However c
, c
not c
everybody c
is c
so c
lucky c
that c
they c
can c
make c
sure c
they c
do c
not c
carry c
any c
disease i
genes c
. c

Therefore c
, c
once c
people c
find c
they c
have i
carried c
the c
disease i
genes c
, c
they c
should c
be c
responsible c
to c
tell c
their c
relatives c
, c
at c
least c
their c
family c
members c
. c

It c
may c
be c
awkward c
and c
embarrassed i
for c
a c
person c
to c
tell c
relatives c
that c
he c
or c
she c
is c
a c
carrier c
of c
a c
known c
genetic c
risk c
. c

But c
they c
are c
all c
from c
one c
family c
and c
own c
the c
same c
forefather c
, c
then i
of c
course c
they c
own c
the c
same c
genes c
in c
some c
part i
. c

Therefore c
there c
is c
nothing c
to c
be c
shy c
for i
or c
be c
afraid c
of c
. c

If c
the i
person c
tell i
their i
relatives c
that c
he c
or c
she c
carries c
a c
disease i
gene c
, c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
can c
go c
to c
hospital c
to c
check c
whether c
they c
also c
get i
a c
disease i
gene c
. c

Then c
the c
relatives c
can c
prepare c
themselves c
to c
prevent c
the c
disease c
to i
occur c
. c

Also c
they c
can c
prevent c
the c
disease c
going c
to c
their c
offspring c
. c

If c
the c
relatives c
carry c
that i
disease i
gene c
, c
they c
can c
share c
the c
experience c
with c
him c
or c
her c
and c
give c
some c
help c
, i
they i
will c
also c
teach c
him c
or c
her c
how c
to c
communicate c
with c
others c
about c
this c
issue c
. c

If c
he c
or c
her i
not i
get i
married c
, c
he c
or c
she c
must c
tell c
his c
or c
her c
partner c
that c
he i
carries c
disease i
gene c
. c

Then c
they c
can c
have c
a c
healthy c
baby c
with c
the c
help c
of c
the c
doctors c
. c

Or c
else c
, c
if c
he c
holds c
back i
the c
genetic c
risk c
, c
they c
may c
have c
a i
unhealthy c
baby c
and c
may c
cause c
the c
death c
of c
the c
baby c
or c
end c
of c
their c
marriage c
. c

There c
is c
a c
story c
I c
watched c
on c
TV c
. c

A c
couple c
did c
not c
have c
a c
child c
after c
their c
marriage c
for c
a c
long c
time c
, i
their i
parents c
were c
anxious c
about c
that c
and c
asked c
them c
to c
go c
to c
hospital c
to c
check c
what c
was i
the c
problem c
. c

After c
came i
back c
from c
the c
hospital c
, c
the c
man c
told c
his c
parents c
that c
the c
problem c
was c
that c
he c
carried c
a c
disease i
gene c
so c
that c
they c
can i
not c
have c
a c
baby c
in c
their c
life c
time c
. c

The c
woman c
did c
not c
know c
the c
test c
result c
, c
but c
she c
overheard c
the c
talk c
and c
decided c
to c
divorce c
with i
her c
husband c
. c

After c
got i
the c
divorce c
certificate c
, c
the c
man c
showed c
her c
the c
test c
report c
; c
it c
wrote c
that c
the c
woman c
carried c
the c
disease i
gene c
instead c
of c
the c
man c
. c

At c
that c
time c
, c
the c
woman c
known i
how c
much c
her c
husband c
loved c
her c
but c
she c
ruined c
her c
happiness c
. c

Tears c
showed c
nothing c
. c

People c
can c
not c
avoid c
carrying c
the i
disease i
genes c
, c
which c
they c
born i
with c
. c

However c
, c
they c
can c
avoid c
the c
disease i
genes c
being c
inhered i
to c
their c
children c
. c

By i
telling i
their c
relatives c
that c
they c
may c
have c
a c
risk c
of c
carrying c
the i
disease i
gene c
can c
make c
their c
family c
members c
bond c
closely c
, i
also i
many c
risks c
and c
conflicts c
can c
be c
avoided c
. c

Genetic c
testing c
has c
become c
a c
beneficial c
way c
to c
predict c
and i
protect c
each c
individual c
at c
risk c
for i
a c
disorder c
. c

However c
, c
there c
rises c
a c
family-related c
ethical c
dilemma c
if i
it c
is c
right c
to c
tell c
a c
carrier c
's c
family c
once c
the c
test c
has c
been c
conducted c
and c
the c
results c
are c
known c
. c

I c
am c
most c
inclined c
to c
believe c
that c
his c
or c
her c
relatives c
have c
the c
rights c
to c
know c
the c
result c
. c

The c
answer c
is c
simply c
that c
everyone c
, c
especially c
our c
family c
, c
has c
the c
right c
to c
know c
the c
truth c
. c

Though i
it i
is c
said c
that c
genetic c
testing c
involves c
emotional c
and c
social c
risks c
due c
to c
the c
test c
results c
, i
while i
the c
potential c
negative c
impacts c
of c
the c
risk c
still c
exist c
, c
the c
consequence c
will c
be c
significant c
if c
other c
members c
of c
his c
or c
her c
family c
do c
not c
know c
. c

Then c
they c
are c
unable c
to c
have c
a c
suitable c
method c
to c
protect c
themselves c
and c
emotional i
preparations c
. c

Taking c
Angeline c
Jolie c
for c
example c
, c
she c
is c
famous c
but c
she c
still c
revealed c
the c
truth c
about c
her c
genetic c
testing c
on i
the c
development c
of c
her c
breast c
cancer c
risk c
. c

Everything c
is c
not c
that c
bad c
if c
you c
know c
how c
to c
look c
at c
the c
bright c
side c
with c
hope c
. c

People c
may c
feel c
angry c
, c
depressed c
, c
or c
even c
guilty c
about c
their c
results c
. c

In c
some c
cases c
, c
a c
carrier c
can c
suffer c
tension c
within c
a c
family c
because c
the c
result c
is c
also c
related c
to c
the c
others c
' c
risk c
somehow i
. c

However c
, c
I c
believe c
it c
is c
just c
a i
usual c
reaction c
to i
this c
situation c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
though i
it c
can c
be c
possible c
in c
some c
cases c
that i
he i
or c
she c
and c
the c
family c
can i
undergo c
specific c
discrimination c
in c
employment c
and c
their c
social c
life c
, c
how i
people i
can i
face i
more i
dramatic c
tragedy c
such c
as c
sickness c
or i
death c
if i
they c
can c
not c
even c
overcome c
this c
harsh c
situation c
. c

Life c
is c
hard c
but c
people c
can c
not c
blame i
it c
on i
being i
unfair c
. c

It c
is c
just i
because c
that i
you i
do i
not c
become i
strong c
enough c
to c
overcome c
the c
hard c
time i
. c

Furthermore c
, c
living c
with c
a c
secret c
is c
not c
a c
good c
sensation c
, c
especially c
if c
the c
situations c
of c
other c
relatives c
become i
worse c
, i
you i
should i
feel c
guilty c
and c
depressed c
. c

Moreover c
, c
the c
truth c
can c
not c
be c
hidden c
forever c
but c
when c
it c
is c
revealed i
, c
more i
shocking c
and c
upset c
it c
will c
be c
. c

As c
the i
result c
, c
it c
is c
in c
the c
interests c
of c
the c
carriers c
and c
their c
relatives c
, c
telling i
the c
genetic c
testing c
result c
is i
needed c
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
, c
though c
genetic c
testing c
is c
a c
personal c
matter c
, c
telling c
the c
result c
to c
your c
family c
can c
improve c
and c
develop c
understanding c
and c
sympathy c
of i
each c
other c
as c
well c
as c
promoting i
awareness c
of c
taking i
care c
of c
everyone c
's c
health c
. c

That c
plays c
an c
important c
role c
in c
the i
possibility c
that c
relatives c
can i
overcome c
the c
discrimination c
of c
the c
society c
and c
anxiety c
about c
the c
risks c
. c

To c
put c
it c
in c
the i
nutshell c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
people c
should c
have c
the c
obligation c
to c
tell c
their c
relatives c
about c
the c
genetic c
testing c
result c
for c
the c
good c
of c
their c
health c
. c

It c
can c
be c
very c
difficult c
for c
them c
but c
necessary c
for c
the c
carriers c
and c
their c
family c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
emotional c
preparations c
and c
the c
ways c
you c
explain c
your c
genetic c
condition c
is i
also c
important c
so c
that c
you c
can c
convey c
the c
correct c
information c
to c
your c
family c
and c
relatives c
and c
if c
necessary c
to i
guide c
them c
if c
he/she i
wish c
to c
conduct c
a c
similar c
genetic c
testing i
. c

The c
Impact c
Of c
Social c
Media c

Social c
media c
has c
been c
playing c
a c
vital c
important c
role c
in c
our c
lives c
today c
. c

It c
is c
almost c
imposible c
for c
us c
to c
keep c
way c
from c
it c
. c

I c
started c
invoving i
into i
Facebook c
one c
years i
ago,when c
I c
just c
arrived c
singapore i
. i

And i
now c
I c
got c
over c
500 c
friends c
on c
Facebook c
and c
buried i
myself c
with c
hundrends i
of c
seeds c
every c
day c
. c

We c
know c
each c
others c
' c
status c
, c
changements i
and c
so c
on c
through c
the c
social c
media c
. c

For c
an i
example c
, c
if c
we c
change c
our c
contact c
numbers c
, c
we c
will c
not c
send c
SMS c
to c
each c
of i
individual c
any c
longer c
. c

Instead c
, c
we c
will c
post c
a c
seed c
and c
tag c
our c
friends c
to c
inform i
this i
kind c
of c
changments c
. c

And c
if c
you c
are c
not c
on c
it c
, c
you c
will c
just c
get c
lost c
. c

In c
certain c
aspects c
, c
social c
media c
has c
brought c
us c
quite c
a c
lot c
of c
convenience c
. c

It c
is c
becoming c
even c
more c
convinient i
than c
talking c
throught i
the c
phone c
since c
it c
is c
free c
. c

We c
discuss c
every c
thing c
we c
like c
and c
we c
have c
more c
personal c
space.Our c
friends c
also c
got c
more c
access c
to c
know c
what c
we c
are c
doing c
and c
what c
we c
like c
. c

And c
also c
, c
we c
get c
a c
chance c
to c
talk c
to c
public c
people c
like c
popular c
stars c
and c
know c
their c
life c
better c
. c

In c
China c
, c
a c
lot c
of c
government c
organizations c
have c
open c
blogs c
to c
communicate c
with c
people c
, c
like c
firefighters c
, c
police c
stations c
and c
so c
on c
. c

Socia c
media c
allows c
them c
to c
explain i
to c
or c
inform c
people c
what i
is c
going c
on c
. c

And c
actually c
lots c
of c
rescuing i
jobs c
are c
done c
with c
the c
help c
of c
social c
media c
like c
looking c
for c
people c
get i
lost c
and c
so c
on c
. c

With c
more c
convinient i
and c
humanian i
communications c
, c
the c
relationship c
between c
government c
and c
people c
get i
largely c
improved c
. c

What c
's c
more c
, c
various c
of i
cultures c
can c
be c
shown c
to c
us c
through c
social c
medias c
. c

We c
can c
know c
more c
news c
and c
cultures c
through c
socia c
medias c
. c

From c
this c
scope c
, c
social c
media c
has c
shorten i
our c
distance c
. c

However c
, c
we i
get c
less c
chance i
and c
less i
importance c
to i
talk i
face c
to c
face c
since i
social c
media c
is c
so c
convinient i
, c
advanced c
and c
interesting c
. c

And c
even c
we i
gather c
together c
more i
people c
find c
themselves i
has i
less c
topics c
to c
talk c
than i
before c
and c
choose c
to c
digging i
from c
their c
social c
media c
again c
. c

When c
we c
are c
far c
away c
, c
social c
media c
makes c
it c
as c
we i
are c
infront i
of c
each c
other c
; c
sometimes c
when c
we c
are c
by c
each c
others c
' c
side c
, c
we c
are i
seem c
to c
be c
further c
than c
far c
away c
. c

This c
kind c
of c
feeling c
makes c
people c
's c
relationship c
not c
as c
stable c
, c
secure c
and c
reliable c
than i
before c
. c

Besides c
, c
there c
are c
more c
people c
shwing i
their c
pictures c
of c
yummy c
food c
or c
travelling c
experience i
. c

To c
some c
extent c
, c
this c
makes c
our c
life c
more c
luxry i
and c
blundering c
. c

For c
myself c
, c
I c
am i
long c
to i
some c
places c
after c
I c
saw i
those i
beatiful i
pictures c
taken c
by c
my c
firneds c
. c

Sometimes c
I c
even i
canoot i
sleep c
well c
because c
of c
excitement c
. c

Social c
media c
makes c
our c
life i
patten c
so c
fast c
and i
left i
us c
less c
time c
to c
think c
about c
our c
life c
. c

Social c
media c
is c
becoming c
more c
important c
and c
we c
need c
to c
think c
more c
to c
make c
it c
serve c
us c
better c
and c
better c
. c

Interpersonal c
skills c
, c
like c
any c
other c
skills c
requires i
practice c
. c

Besides c
that c
, c
these c
skills c
requires i
time c
to c
develop c
and c
adapted i
. c

The c
burgeoning c
of c
social c
media c
definitely c
has c
its c
stint i
; c
but c
amongst i
all c
good c
things c
, c
it c
is c
better c
to c
have c
them c
in c
moderation c
. c

Convenience c
and c
efficiency c
are c
two c
very c
important c
use i
of c
social c
media c
. c

While c
millions c
of c
users c
are c
connect i
at c
any c
one c
time c
, c
any c
information c
can c
be c
readily c
available c
at c
their c
perusal c
. c

This c
improves c
the c
connectivity c
between c
the c
users c
. c

For c
an i
example c
, c
one c
is c
able c
to c
send c
notifications c
and c
other c
information c
we c
use i
to c
have c
them i
in c
hardcopy c
previously c
, c
over c
the c
web c
and c
the c
process c
takes c
seconds c
. c

The c
receipent,will i
then c
receive c
the c
information c
almost c
immediately c
depending c
on c
the c
quality c
of c
the c
network c
. c

This c
covenience i
can c
be c
percieved c
as c
almost c
in c
realtime c
. c

Next c
, c
communication i
are c
also c
greatly c
improved c
. c

In c
the c
past c
, c
vast i
communication i
are i
done c
by c
one c
of c
the i
many c
such c
a i
telegram c
, c
snail c
mail c
and c
poor-quality c
voice c
calls c
. c

With c
the c
welcoming c
of c
application i
such c
as c
Skype c
and c
Facetime c
, c
any c
individual c
can c
phase c
off c
most c
, i
of c
the c
olden c
days c
communication i
methods c
. c

Aside c
from c
hearing c
the c
voice c
, c
a c
webcamera c
could c
also c
be c
affixed c
to c
emulate c
a c
'real c
' c
interaction c
with c
expressions c
and c
gestures c
. c

Communication c
would c
have c
took c
a c
different c
turn c
without c
the c
easily c
available c
social c
media c
. c

However c
, c
it c
is c
a c
good c
practice c
not c
to c
intesively i
use c
social c
media c
all c
the c
time c
. c

Intimate c
interaction i
greatly c
lack c
in c
social c
media c
interactions c
, c
particularly c
the i
touch c
. c

Having c
to c
meet c
and c
interact c
for c
talks c
allows c
one c
to c
be c
closer c
to c
the c
recepient c
. c

It c
involves c
a c
level c
of c
dynamic c
interaction c
which c
utlises c
the c
motor c
, c
thinking c
and c
verbal c
cortex c
of c
the c
mind c
to i
coordinate i
. c

Unlike c
the c
use c
of c
social c
media c
, c
most c
of c
the c
interaction c
is c
done c
with c
thinking c
and c
typing c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
one c
does c
not c
train c
the c
necessarily i
parts i
of c
the c
skills c
required c
for c
a i
proper c
interpersonal c
relations c
. c

It c
is c
also c
entire i
incorrect c
to c
fault c
social c
media c
alone c
for c
the c
lack c
of c
interpersonal c
skill i
. c

Howard c
Garner c
studied c
the c
effect c
of c
multiple c
intelligences c
amongst c
people c
and c
stated c
that c
interpersonal c
intelligence c
is c
a c
form c
of c
skills c
on c
its c
own c
- c
some c
has i
it c
, c
some c
does i
not c
. c

Howard c
Garner c
mentioned c
that c
the c
different c
intelligences c
can c
be c
charted c
, c
in c
accordance c
of c
utilising c
tests c
, c
and c
ranked c
. c

Fundamentally c
, c
those c
who c
scored i
lower c
ranking i
for c
interpersonal c
skills c
are c
more c
likely c
to c
stumble c
when c
this c
skill c
is c
needed c
. c

Though c
social c
media c
need c
not c
be c
necessarily c
bad c
, c
it c
must c
be c
used c
accordingly c
- c
for c
work c
, c
family c
, c
friends c
. c

The c
types c
of c
use c
must c
also c
be c
taken c
note c
of c
- c
informing c
, c
interacting c
, c
discussion c
and c
others c
. c

The c
space c
of c
separation c
between c
the c
parties c
must c
also c
be c
looked c
at c
. c

For c
people c
who c
are c
living c
very c
far c
from c
one c
another c
, c
the c
intensive c
use c
social i
media c
is c
justified c
. c

For i
those i
who c
lives i
within c
the c
community c
should c
at c
least c
meet c
up c
, c
and c
not c
use c
social c
media c
as c
the c
primary c
source c
of c
communcation c
with c
each c
other c
. c

And c
at c
the c
same c
time c
, c
improves i
the i
interpersonal c
skill i
, c
through c
dynamic c
practises i
betwwen c
individuals c
and c
realtime c
presence c
. c

The c
inclusion c
of c
intimate c
presence c
and c
relative c
touch c
could c
also c
bring c
a c
better c
rapport c
between c
those c
interacting c
. c

Recently c
, c
the c
rise c
of c
social c
media c
helped i
people c
to c
have c
more c
closer c
connection c
with c
each c
other c
, i
it c
is c
a c
more c
convenient c
and c
cheaper c
way c
to c
have c
online c
contact c
compared c
with c
face c
to c
face c
meetings c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
social c
media c
websides c
such c
as c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
will c
not c
affect c
the c
chance c
for c
people c
to c
have c
face c
to c
face c
contact c
and c
thus c
negatively c
affects i
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

On c
the c
other i
hand c
, c
it c
may c
even c
increase c
the c
chance c
of c
having c
face c
to c
face c
contacts c
amoung c
people c
. c

First c
, c
social c
media c
networks c
have c
a c
lot i
user c
base c
, i
it c
helps c
to c
link c
people c
from c
different c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
. c

In c
the c
days c
without c
the c
social c
networks c
, c
people c
may c
not c
have c
the i
chance c
to c
know c
others c
from c
different c
countries c
or c
the i
ones c
they c
never c
meet i
before c
. c

Their i
number c
of c
people c
that c
they c
know i
may c
only i
limited i
to c
the c
people c
they c
meet i
in c
daily c
life c
like c
classmates c
and c
working c
partners c
. c

Therefore c
, c
social c
networks c
brings i
more c
and c
more c
connections c
between c
people c
and c
they c
may c
have c
a c
chance c
to c
chat c
with c
people c
they c
never i
known c
before c
, c
and c
this c
helps c
to c
develop c
the c
interpersonal c
skills c
as c
well c
. c

Secondly c
, c
although c
social c
network c
takes c
time c
for i
people c
to i
chat c
online i
but c
not c
face c
to c
face c
, c
they c
may c
still c
decide c
a c
time c
online c
to c
meet c
others c
face c
to c
face c
in c
the i
daily c
life c
. c

In c
this c
case c
, c
the c
social c
network c
helps c
people c
to c
increase c
the c
frequency c
of c
talk c
. c

For c
example c
, c
if c
social c
network c
does i
not c
exist c
, c
the i
business c
people c
need i
to c
meet c
each c
other c
face c
to c
face c
and c
it c
is c
other i
time c
consuming c
, c
even c
sometimes c
with c
business c
that c
is c
not c
so c
important c
, c
it c
still c
takes c
a c
lot c
time c
on i
travel c
which i
is c
a i
wastage c
. c

However c
, c
social c
network c
helps c
people c
to c
meet c
and c
chat c
much c
more c
easier i
, i
they c
can c
even c
use c
video c
chat c
and c
create c
group c
chat c
to c
chat c
with c
multiple c
parties c
at c
the c
same c
time c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
even i
some c
companies c
conduct c
online c
video c
interview c
with c
their c
applicants c
as c
it c
saves c
time c
and c
cost c
. c

The c
social c
network c
may c
also c
creat i
some c
negative c
impacts c
for c
the i
people c
. c

The c
largest c
negative c
impact c
is c
that c
due i
to c
the c
online c
network c
, c
some c
people c
start c
to c
use c
and c
rely c
on c
internet c
every c
minute c
. c

They c
take c
too c
much c
time c
of i
using c
online c
social c
network i
and c
thus c
do c
not c
have c
time c
to c
have c
their c
daily c
meeting i
with c
people c
in c
their c
real c
life i
. c

It c
not c
only c
affect i
the i
interpersonal c
skills c
but c
also i
bad c
for c
people c
's c
health c
if c
the i
ones c
spend c
to c
much c
time c
on c
the i
social c
media c
. c

Secondly c
, c
social c
network c
may c
leak c
certain c
personal c
informations i
to c
the c
public c
, c
as c
the c
cyber c
environment c
is c
not c
perfect c
and c
not c
safe c
, i
people c
may c
not c
protect c
their c
privacy c
online c
effectively c
and c
sometimes c
, c
some c
people c
may c
use c
others c
personal i
information c
to c
deceive c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
although i
the c
unsafe c
online i
environment i
, c
spend i
too c
much c
time c
on c
internet i
may i
be i
the c
potential c
negative c
factors c
of c
using c
online c
social c
networks c
. c

It i
provides i
people c
with c
more i
convenient c
contact c
environment c
and c
improve c
the c
frequency c
of c
meeting c
with c
each i
others c
. c

It c
also c
helps c
people c
to c
develop c
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
through c
online c
chating i
. c

Overall c
, c
there c
are c
more c
benefits c
than c
the i
costs c
. c

The c
wolrd i
is c
incresingly i
becoming c
flat c
by i
all c
kinds c
of c
social c
network c
website i
such c
as c
facebook c
and c
twitter c
. c

We c
can c
even c
know c
what c
a c
friend c
who c
leave i
thousands c
of c
miles c
away c
eat i
for c
lunch c
though i
these c
kinds c
of c
social c
media c
. c

From c
some c
points c
of c
view c
, c
social c
really i
has c
a c
lot c
of c
advantages c
by c
let i
us c
communicate c
with c
friends c
cheaper i
and c
more c
conveniently c
. c

However c
, c
its c
disadvantages c
also c
can c
not c
be c
ingnored i
when c
you c
cosider i
it c
as c
a c
platform c
to c
show c
off c
and c
a c
stage c
for c
cyber c
crime c
. c

Social c
network c
sites c
provides i
us c
many i
convenience i
. c

Without c
hanging c
out c
with c
friends c
or c
talking c
with c
friends c
through c
phone i
, c
we c
can c
know c
his c
of c
her c
latest c
news c
by c
scaning i
the c
webpage c
. c

It c
can c
help c
us c
know c
more c
about c
each c
other c
. c

It c
can c
make c
people c
become c
closer c
as c
well c
. c

For c
example c
, c
if c
you c
find c
out c
one c
of c
your c
friend c
's c
favourite c
singer c
is c
Justin c
Biber c
through c
facebook c
, c
you c
can c
give c
him c
or c
her c
Justin c
Biber c
's c
new c
album c
or c
concert c
ticket c
as c
a c
birthday c
gift c
. c

It c
will c
be c
really c
sweet c
and c
you c
two c
will c
surelly c
become c
closer c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
social c
network c
site i
can c
help c
you c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
friends c
living c
very c
far c
away c
. c

I c
met c
some c
canadian c
friends c
in c
Egypt c
. c

Without c
facebook c
, c
we c
may c
lost i
contact c
. c

However c
, c
thanks c
to c
facebook c
, c
I c
can c
still c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
them c
and c
I c
know c
what c
they c
are c
doing c
recently c
as c
we c
living i
close c
to c
each c
other c
. c

The c
disadvantages c
of c
social c
network c
media c
are c
quite c
undeniable c
. c

A c
research i
shows c
that c
people c
will c
unconsciously c
hide c
his i
or c
her c
real c
thought c
when c
he i
or i
her i
say c
or c
post c
something c
that c
will c
be c
exposed c
to c
the c
public c
. c

It c
means c
that c
one c
can c
not c
know c
another c
's c
real c
thought c
and c
personalities i
by c
reading c
things c
that i
he i
or i
she i
put c
on c
social c
network c
media c
. c

It c
will c
make c
him c
or c
her c
quite c
upset c
when c
they c
communicate c
in c
real c
life c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
with c
all c
those c
" c
nice c
" c
guys c
around c
on c
the c
social c
network c
website c
, c
one c
may c
neglect c
people c
surrounding c
him c
or c
her c
but i
just c
communicate c
with c
friends c
on c
facebook c
. c

It c
is c
a c
common c
scene c
that c
two c
people c
sitting c
next c
to c
each c
other c
seldom c
talk c
with c
each c
other c
but c
just c
look c
at c
their c
cellphone c
. c

This c
kind c
of c
behaviour c
is c
not c
good c
to i
people c
's c
psychological c
health c
according c
to c
a i
research c
. c

The c
cyber c
communication c
is c
quite c
different c
to c
face c
to c
face c
communication c
and c
people c
who c
depends i
on c
cyber c
communication c
too c
much c
will c
not c
get c
used c
to c
the i
real c
life c
communication c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
cyber c
relationship i
can c
not c
always c
work c
in c
real c
life c
. c

With c
no c
close c
relationship c
in c
real c
life c
but c
only c
close c
cyber c
friends c
, c
one c
is c
more c
possibly i
to c
feel c
lonely c
because c
the c
physiological c
need c
of c
human c
beings c
is c
to c
feel c
the c
bond c
with c
others c
by i
our c
five c
senses c
. c

With c
the c
willing c
of c
people c
to c
become c
the c
best c
among c
others c
, c
social c
network c
site i
now c
become c
a c
place c
to c
show c
off c
. c

Some c
people c
will c
to i
post c
their c
expensive c
thing i
or c
the c
oversea i
places c
of c
interest c
they c
have c
been c
on c
the c
social c
network c
and c
get c
a c
feeling c
of c
satisfaction c
by c
doing c
so c
. c

It c
is c
a i
mental i
unhealth i
and c
it c
may c
trigger c
people c
especially c
teenagers c
to c
become c
material c
. c

The i
last c
but c
not c
the c
least c
, c
with c
all c
kinds c
of c
personal c
information c
on c
one c
's c
social c
network c
page c
, c
it c
is c
covenient c
for c
criminal i
to c
make c
use c
of c
this c
information c
to c
commit c
a c
crime c
. c

Above c
all c
, c
social c
network c
site i
is i
like c
a c
two c
sided c
knife c
and c
people c
can c
only c
take c
good c
advantage c
of c
it i
by c
avoiding c
the c
possible c
disadvantages c
of i
it i
such c
as c
put i
less c
personal c
information c
on c
his i

her i
facebook c

The c
modes c
of c
communication c
have c
been c
changing c
over c
the c
years c
, c
from c
letter c
writing c
to c
social c
networking c
. c

This c
phenomenon c
is c
caused c
by c
rapidly c
changing c
technology c
, c
which c
has c
made c
communication c
to c
be c
faster c
than c
never i
before c
. c

Today c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
such c
as c
Facebook c
and c
Twitter c
, c
are c
relatively c
common c
within c
the i
contemporary c
society c
; c
and c
, c
people c
can c
communicate c
with c
each c
other c
, c
online c
or c
offline c
, c
on c
these c
social c
networking c
platforms c
. c

They c
can c
even c
make c
new c
friends c
over i
similar c
interests c
on c
these c
platforms c
, c
which i
will i
be i
able c
to c
connect c
almost c
everyone i
closely c
in c
many c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
. c

However c
, c
critics c
may c
argue c
that c
with i
the c
existence c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
have c
reduced c
physical c
human c
interactions c
among c
people c
as c
they c
will i
prefer c
sitting c
in c
front c
of c
a c
computer c
to c
going c
out c
and c
meeting c
new c
friends c
. c

This c
essay c
will c
discuss c
about i
both c
the c
benefits c
and c
down c
sides c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
the c
contemporary c
society c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
social c
media c
are c
able c
to c
disseminate c
information c
faster c
than c
any c
other c
media c
. c

There c
are i
about c
50 c
% c
of c
the c
people i
who c
have i
learnt c
about c
breaking c
news c
from c
social c
media c
. c

This c
is c
due c
to c
people c
spending c
comparatively c
more c
time c
on c
social c
networking c
than c
time c
on c
reading c
newpapers c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
with c
the c
current c
technology c
, c
smartphones c
are c
able c
to c
get c
access c
to c
social c
media c
sites c
which c
have c
made i
easier c
for c
consumers c
to c
use c
. c

Hence c
, c
social c
media c
has c
benefited c
the c
masses c
by c
equipping c
them c
with c
a c
powerful c
tool c
to c
disseminate c
information c
almost c
immediate i
to c
the c
people c
around c
them c
. c

However c
, c
critics c
may c
argue c
that c
not c
all c
information c
or c
news c
disseminated c
are c
reliable c
. c

There c
might c
be c
false c
information c
or c
hoaxes c
spreading c
around c
on c
social c
media c
. c

For c
example c
, c
in c
2012 c
, c
there c
were c
false c
rumors c
of c
fires c
, c
shootouts c
, c
and c
caravans c
of c
gunmen c
in c
a c
Mexico c
City c
suburb c
which c
had i
spread c
through c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
. c

This c
had i
caused c
panic c
among c
the i
people c
who c
had i
flooded c
the c
local c
police c
department c
with c
numerous c
phone c
calls c
, c
and c
this c
had i
resulted c
temporarily i
closed i
of c
schools c
. c

The c
spreading c
of c
false c
information c
can c
be c
a c
potential c
psychological c
threat c
to c
everyone c
, c
given c
that c
social c
media c
can c
disseminate c
information c
in c
a c
realtively i
fast c
speed c
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
there c
are c
cyber c
polices i
who c
roam c
around c
these c
social c
networking c
platforms c
to c
prevent c
these c
hoaxes c
spreading c
around c
. c

But c
, c
there c
will c
still c
be c
unreliable c
sources c
spreading c
false c
information c
on c
social c
media c
sites c
despite c
high c
security c
to i
control c
almost i
every c
social c
networking c
movement c
. c

Social c
media c
are c
able c
to c
improve c
relationship i
and c
make c
new c
friends c
, c
provided c
that c
there c
is c
mutual c
trust c
and c
mutual c
understanding c
between c
both c
parties c
. c

Many c
of c
the c
teenagers c
today c
claimed i
that c
they c
are c
able c
to c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
their c
friends c
through c
social c
media c
, c
regardless c
of c
their c
location c
. c

In c
the c
past c
, c
people c
used c
to c
writing i
letters c
to c
their c
friends c
and c
it c
will i
take c
relatively i
long c
time c
to c
send c
the c
letter c
over c
. c

Therefore c
, c
with c
the c
help c
of c
technology c
, c
people c
are c
able c
to c
catch c
up c
wth i
each c
other c
conveniently c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
it c
will i
be c
easier c
to c
make c
new c
friends c
find i
who c
have c
simliar c
interests c
or c
hobbies c
. c

However c
, c
in c
order c
for c
people c
to c
maintain c
their c
relationship i
as c
well c
as c
making i
new c
friends c
, c
it c
requires c
mutual c
trust c
and c
understanding c
between c
both c
parties c
. c

It c
might c
not c
be c
accurate c
to c
judge c
the c
other c
party c
's c
feelings c
over c
social c
media c
as c
one c
may c
cover c
up c
their c
emotions c
while c
on c
social c
media c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
there c
are c
also c
chances c
for c
people c
to c
miscommunicate c
with c
each c
other c
as c
they c
can c
not c
sense c
the c
tone c
of c
the c
other c
party c
over c
social c
media c
platforms c
. c

This c
will c
result c
in c
unnecessary c
conflicts c
between c
two c
parties c
over c
miscommunication c
. c

But c
, c
if c
there c
is c
trust c
and c
mutual c
understand c
on c
social c
media c
, c
it c
will c
be c
ideal c
for c
people c
to c
improve c
relationship i
and c
make c
new c
friends c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
social c
media c
in c
the i
contemporary c
society c
is c
able c
to c
help c
one c
improve c
relationship i
and c
make c
new c
friends c
, c
as c
well c
as c
, i
disseminate c
information c
efficiently c
to c
the c
masses c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
risks c
of c
false c
information c
and c
chances c
of c
miscommunication c
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
the c
advantages c
of c
social c
media c
will c
benefit c
the c
masses c
if c
the c
negative c
aspects c
of i
it i
can c
be c
carefully c
taken c
care c
of c
. c

All-in-all c
, c
social c
media c
is c
the c
product c
of c
rapid c
technological c
advancement c
and c
there c
are i
more c
to c
come c
in c
future c
. c

Advantages c
: c
Social c
media c
sites c
have c
greatly c
ease i
long c
distance c
communication c
and c
interaction c
due c
to c
its i
accessibility c
and c
convenience c
. c

With c
a c
globalised c
and c
interconnected c
world c
today c
, c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
are c
now c
the c
mainstream c
platform c
for c
social c
interaction c
. c

With c
just c
a c
touch c
away c
from c
any c
meida/electronic c
devices c
, c
one c
can c
easily c
interact c
and c
communicate c
with c
his i
friends c
without c
much c
hassle c
. c

Thus c
, c
long c
distance c
relationship i
or c
friendship c
can c
be c
maintain i
and c
keeping c
in c
touch c
with c
your c
circle c
of c
friends c
has c
been c
made c
much c
easier c
. c

With c
the c
sharing c
of c
personal c
photos c
, c
posting c
of c
status c
of c
one c
's c
personal c
feeling c
or c
experience c
and c
able i
to c
reply c
to c
these c
posts c
allowed i
human c
interaction c
to i
be i
engage i
and c
expand i
with c
ease c
. c

Introverts c
or c
those c
who c
are c
shy c
to c
communicate c
with c
their c
friends c
are c
now c
able c
to c
do c
so c
in c
the c
form c
of c
words c
via c
social c
media c
platform i
. c

Thus c
, c
socialisation c
can c
occur c
seamlessly c
and c
effectively c
with c
the c
utilisation c
of c
such c
social c
media c
platforms.Meet-ups c
and c
appointments c
are c
no c
longer c
a c
barrier c
for c
humans c
to c
contact c
and c
communicate c
with c
one c
another c
, c
making c
human c
interaction c
possible c
at c
one c
's c
own c
convenience c
. c

The c
society c
will c
adapt c
to c
such c
phenomenon c
as c
physical c
interaction c
are c
transformed c
into c
cyber c
interaction c
. c

With c
the c
frequent c
usage c
and c
reliance c
of c
the c
social c
media c
and c
the c
Internet c
, c
a c
society c
that c
socialises c
through c
the c
cyber c
will c
be c
more c
advance i
and c
adapted c
to c
the c
highly c
connected c
world c
. c

This c
will c
greatly c
help c
a c
society c
to c
progress c
rapidly c
. c

Disadvantages c
: c
One c
of c
the c
main c
concerns c
of c
using c
social c
media c
platform i
to c
communicate c
is c
credibility c
. c

The c
certainty c
of c
what c
is c
being c
shared c
or c
expressed c
could c
not c
be c
proven c
physically c
as c
media c
limits c
this c
physical c
interaction c
, c
except c
when c
using c
a c
webcam c
to c
chat c
. c

We c
can c
not c
be c
certain c
for c
sure c
the i
reliabilty c
or c
truth c
of c
some c
posts c
or c
information c
we c
received c
through c
the c
Inetrnet c
. c

We c
may c
in c
actual c
fact c
communicating i
with c
a c
hoax c
Facebook c
acccount c
of c
a c
cyber c
friend c
, c
which c
we c
assume c
to c
be c
real c
but c
in c
reality c
, c
it c
is c
a c
fake c
account c
. c

Photos c
and c
informations c
retrieved c
from c
their c
profile c
page c
may c
be c
fabricated c
to c
suit c
certain c
personal c
agenda c
. c

Thus c
, c
the c
lack c
of c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
through c
social c
media c
restricts c
actual c
interaction c
which c
can c
be c
stimulated c
through c
the c
media c
. c

Although c
emocons c
can c
be c
used c
to c
show c
certain c
emotion i
, c
this c
differs c
from c
the c
real c
authentic c
emotion c
of c
your c
friends c
when c
you c
observed i
them c
through c
their c
body c
language c
and c
their c
facial c
expression c
. c

The c
danger c
of c
such c
media c
socialisation c
is c
the c
uncertainty c
of c
such c
communication c
due c
to c
lack c
of c
physical c
interaction c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
this c
lack c
of c
physical c
interaction c
has c
affected c
human c
inter-personal c
behaviour c
since c
communication c
is c
made c
through c
social c
media c
instead c
of c
meet-ups c
. c

This c
lowers c
the c
experience c
of c
human c
ability c
to c
interact c
with c
one c
another c
which c
can c
adversely c
shape c
one c
's c
behaviour c
. c

The c
lack c
of c
exposure c
to c
real c
life c
interaction c
with c
humans c
with i
not c
create c
the c
confidence c
and c
skills c
needed c
for c
one c
to c
interact c
seamlessly c
and c
effectively c
with c
others c
. c

Therefore c
, c
for c
an c
effective c
and c
efficient c
society c
, c
there c
is c
a c
need c
to c
have c
a c
balance c
of c
both c
social c
media c
interaction c
and c
face-to-face c
human c
interaction c
within c
its c
people c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
people c
can c
even c
use c
their c
phone c
to c
read c
news c
and c
everyone c
can c
be c
the c
first c
witnesses c
of c
what c
is c
happening c
in c
the c
world c
. c

People c
use c
Twitter c
to c
follow c
the c
artiste c
or c
celebrity c
they c
love c
and c
Facebook c
to c
see c
what c
is i
their c
friends c
' c
recent c
activity c
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
they c
still c
can c
use c
phone c
to c
do i
normal i
call c
and c
message c
to c
contact c
. c

Not c
only c
the i
phone c
did i
the c
jobs c
for c
them c
, c
but c
also c
devices c
like c
personal i
computer c
, c
laptop c
, c
tablet c
, c
and c
many c
other c
devices c
which c
are c
able c
to c
connect c
to c
internet c
. c

It c
is c
obvious c
to c
see c
that c
internet c
saves c
people c
's c
time c
and c
also c
connect i
people c
globally c
. c

Several c
arguments c
have c
been c
made c
regarding c
the i
social c
media c
actually c
have i
some c
inevitable c
disadvantages c
to i
people c
. c

People c
can c
only c
use c
electical c
devices c
to c
access c
internet c
. c

Whenever c
they c
need c
to c
use c
social c
media c
, c
they c
have c
to c
use c
a c
phone c
or c
internet c
. c

Generally c
people c
need c
they i
eyes c
to c
look c
at c
the c
display c
screen c
of c
their c
phone c
or c
computer c
and c
fingers c
to c
manipulate c
the c
corresponding c
device c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
they c
will c
lose c
eyes i
to i
contact c
and c
hands c
to c
express c
their c
feeling c
to c
people c
nearby c
them c
, c
which c
means c
they c
have c
lost c
the c
tools c
they c
need c
for c
face-to-face c
contact c
communicating c
. c

This c
can c
be c
easily c
seen c
in c
restaurants c
or c
cafes c
nowadays c
. c

A i
family c
of c
four c
having c
dinners c
in c
a c
restaurant c
without c
any c
chatting c
, c
because c
their c
holding c
and c
looking c
at c
their c
display c
screen c
with c
one c
hand c
when c
the c
other c
hand c
is c
holding c
a c
fork c
. i

A i
group c
of c
friends c
having c
high c
tea c
in c
a c
caf c
é c
without c
chatting c
as c
well c
, c
because c
they c
do c
not c
know c
what c
to c
talk c
but c
pressing c
on c
their c
display c
screen c
. c

The i
children c
nowadays c
do c
not c
know c
what c
is i
neighbourhood c
games c
and i
who c
is c
staying c
beside c
them c
, i
all c
they c
know c
is c
pressing c
icons c
on c
the c
screens c
. c

These c
are c
some c
concrete c
examples c
of c
how c
the c
socia c
media c
reduce c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
. c

When c
people c
get c
use i
of i
using c
socia i
media c
to c
contact c
other c
people c
, c
what c
will c
happen c
is c
that c
their c
interpersonal c
communicating c
skills c
will c
degrade c
and c
lost i
eventually c
. c

Firstly c
, c
they c
have i
lost c
the c
courage c
to c
meet c
strangers c
, c
not c
even c
the c
courage c
to c
talk c
. c

Also c
, c
they c
will c
not c
have c
enough c
experience c
to c
communicate c
with c
people c
in c
face i
and c
not c
be c
trained c
in c
their c
conversation c
skills c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
social c
media c
helps c
them c
do c
the c
jobs c
but c
indirectly c
affects c
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

Social c
media c
does c
have c
some c
other c
advantages c
beside c
their c
general c
benefits c
to c
human c
being i
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
people c
saves i
money c
by c
using c
internet i
to c
contact c
other c
people c
and c
reading i
news c
. c

A c
father c
may c
be c
able c
to c
make c
a c
call c
to c
his c
daughter c
who c
is c
in c
other i
country c
via c
socia i
media c
software c
instead c
of c
making c
international i
call c
which c
costs c
a c
lot c
to c
normal c
salary i
family i
. c

He c
can c
even c
talk c
to c
her i
daughter c
face-to-face c
using c
video c
call c
via c
internet c
. c

Secondly c
, c
people c
makes i
friends c
all c
over c
the c
world c
and c
able i
to c
update c
their c
friends c
his i
recent c
activity c
easily c
. c

A c
guy c
who c
is c
going c
travel i
for c
months c
can c
easily c
tell c
all c
of c
his c
friends c
about c
his c
activity c
. c

When c
one c
of c
his c
friends c
who c
is c
not c
aware c
of c
this c
has c
failed c
to c
contact c
him c
via c
telephone c
calls c
, c
he c
might c
be c
able c
to c
get c
his c
whereabout i
using c
social c
media c
. c

These c
are c
the c
advantages c
that c
save c
works i
most c
of c
the c
time c
. c

In i
conclude c
, c
socia c
media c
benefits c
people c
in c
several c
ways c
but c
in i
the c
same c
time c
harms c
people c
. c

People c
should c
avoid c
the c
misuse c
of c
socia i
media c
and c
use c
it c
in c
the c
proper c
way c
. c

With c
the c
aids i
of c
social c
media c
, c
people c
bonds i
globally c
, c
information c
flows c
rapidly c
, c
and c
human c
lives c
happily c
. c

All c
of c
us c
are c
living c
in c
the i
technology c
realm c
society c
. c

Have c
you c
ever c
wondered c
why c
we c
use c
these c
tools c
to c
connect c
ourselves c
with c
other c
people c
? c

It c
started c
withthe i
invention c
of c
technology c
which c
has c
evolved c
tremendously c
over c
the c
past c
few c
decades c
. c

In c
the c
past c
, c
we c
travel i
by c
ship c
and c
now c
we c
can c
use c
airplane c
to c
do c
so c
. c

In c
the c
past c
, c
it c
took c
a c
few c
days c
to c
receive c
a c
message c
as c
we c
need i
to c
post c
our c
letter c
and c
now c
, c
we c
can c
use c
e-mail c
which c
stands c
for c
electronic c
message c
to c
send c
messages c
to c
our c
friends c
or c
even c
use c
our c
handphone c
to c
send c
our c
messages c
. c

From c
the c
example i
that c
I c
have c
mentioned c
earlier i
we c
can c
see c
that c
distance c
between c
us c
and c
our c
loved c
one i
are i
getting c
further i
apart c
. c

This c
is c
because c
by c
the c
ease c
of c
technology c
such c
as c
airplane c
, c
some c
of c
our c
friends c
might c
be c
going c
overseas c
to c
continue c
their c
studies c
or c
even i
you c
are c
away c
from c
your c
family c
to c
pursue c
your c
studies c
or c
even i
careers i
in c
life c
. c

Thus c
, c
this c
makes c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
become c
one c
of c
the c
medium i
that c
we c
need c
. c

Nevertheless,everything c
in c
life c
has c
positive c
and c
negative c
effects c
. c

This c
is c
applicable c
to c
these c
social c

The c
next c
two c
paragraphs c
will c
be c
discussing c
about i
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
our c
society c
. c

With c
the c
help c
of c
social c
media c
tools c
, c
we c
can c
stay c
in c
contact c
and c
keep c
ourselves c
up c
to c
date c
with c
our c
family c
and c
friends c
even c
though c
we c
are c
away c
from c
them c
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
such c
as c
Facebook c
has i
allow c
us c
to c
share c
our c
pictures c
or c
even c
chat c
online c
with c
our c
parents c
while c
we c
are c
overseas c
. c

This i
approaches c
help c
the c
parents c
to c
communicate c
with c
their c
children c
and c
know c
what c
kind c
of c
activities c
that c
their c
children c
have c
when c
they c
are c
overseas c
. c

The c
social c
media c
is c
beneficial c
as c
it c
connect i
you c
and c
your c
loved c
one c
even c
though c
you c
are c
separated c
by c
the i
distance c
. c

It c
might c
not c
be c
able c
to c
replace c
the c
joy c
that c
you c
have c
when c
you c
are c
with c
your c
family c
but c
it c
could c
help c
to c
reduce c
the c
sadness c
of c
being c
away c
from c
your c
family c
. c

As c
I c
mentioned c
in c
the c
beginning c
, c
there c
is i
also c
disadvantages c
of c
social c
media c
tools c
. c

One c
of c
them c
is c
that c
it c
reduce i
the c
level c
of c
concentration c
especially c
among c
the i
youngsters c
. c

This c
is c
because c
it c
is c
part c
of c
everyone c
's c
habit c
to c
check c
their c
facebook c
's c
page c
as c
their c
friends c
will c
post c
something c
new c
every c
second c
. c

Thus c
, c
you c
can c
see c
that c
some c
students c
will c
browse c
facebook c
while c
attending c
lectures c
. c

This c
means c
that c
the c
students c
are c
not c
concetrating c
when c
they c
supposed c
to c
do c
so c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
it c
could c
affect c
their c
lives c
and c
studies c
. c

This c
will i
then c
could c
lead c
to c
stress c
as c
these c
students c
are c
not c
able c
to c
cope c
with c
their c
studies c
because c
they c
were i
distracted c
. c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
every c
individual c
has c
to c
take c
responsibility c
of i
their c
own c
lives c
by c
making c
a c
right c
decision c
. c

There c
are c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
in c
using c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
however c
in c
this c
case c
striking c
balance c
between c
social c
media c
and c
lives c
is c
the c
most c
important c
thing c
to c
do c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
the c
use c
of c
the i
sociall i
media c
platforms c
is c
a c
commonplace c
in c
our c
lives c
. c

In c
increasingly i
globalised c
world c
, c
such c
platforms c
even c
enhances i
and c
compliccates i
the c
links c
between c
indivduals c
in c
the c
world c
. c

Thanks c
to c
them c
, c
people c
can c
get c
to c
know c
one c
another c
online c
, c
without c
having c
to c
travel c
to c
meet c
up c
for c
business c
purposes c
for c
companies c
or c
personal c
reasons c
. c

However c
, c
it c
is c
also c
bringing c
some c
social c
changes c
whereby c
such c
virtual c
worlds c
are c
overtaking c
the c
real-life c
world c
, c
resulting c
in c
some c
negative c
impacts c
in c
individuaul i
's c
daily c
lives c
and c
therefore c
becoming c
a c
large c
problem c
in c
societies c
as c
a c
whole c
. c

As c
people c
spend c
more c
and c
more c
time c
on c
such c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
the c
importance c
of c
the i
face-to-face c
human c
contacts i
has c
decresed i
. c

As c
people c
feel c
more c
confident c
online c
where c
they c
do c
not c
have c
to c
face c
in i
real-life c
on c
the c
spot c
, c
they c
feel c
more c
comfortable c
and c
thus c
prefer c
communicating c
online i
. c

This c
results c
in c
lack i
of c
interpersonal c
skills c
in c
individual i
, c
especially c
young c
students c
as c
they c
always c
have c
option i
to c
turn c
their c
back c
to c
the i
real-life c
and c
go c
online c
. c

This c
becomes c
a c
huge c
problem c
when c
they c
have c
no c
choice c
but c
have c
to c
face c
things c
in c
real c
life c
. c

As c
they c
are c
so c
used c
to c
having c
an c
online c
avatar c
, c
they c
may c
lose c
their c
self-identity c
in c
real c
life c
and c
may c
not c
realise c
how c
to c
interact c
people i
in c
real-life c
. c

Another c
problem c
with c
social c
media c
is c
that c
, c
the c
benefits c
from c
investing c
such c
enormous c
time c
and c
energy c
is c
not c
relfected i
as c
something c
positive c
to c
the c
users c
. c

The c
reason c
why c
it c
is c
so c
addictive c
is c
, c
that c
the c
more c
people c
get c
into c
the c
social c
media c
, c
they c
seek c
attention c
from c
their c
friends c
. c

However c
, c
such c
sparks c
of c
sudden c
attention c
is i
extremely c
short-termed c
and c
gone c
eaily i
thus i
does c
not c
add i
any i
value c
or c
meaning c
to c
the c
user c
's c
life c
. c

Also c
, c
according c
to c
a i
research c
, c
it c
has c
been c
proven c
that c
the c
users c
feel c
more c
sad c
after c
using c
the c
Facebook c
and c
this c
is c
because c
users c
unknowingly c
compare c
their c
lives c
with c
other c
people c
's c
lives c
. c

But i
seriously c
, c
most i
people c
only c
post c
the c
happiest c
moments c
in c
their c
lives c
. c

Social c
media c
definitely c
has c
some c
other c
strong c
benefits c
that c
make c
the c
users c
stay c
is i
the c
links c
among c
the i
people c
. c

Indeed c
, c
I c
myself c
use c
Facebook c
just c
because c
of c
the c
friends c
' c
contacts c
that c
I c
want c
to c
keep c
. c

However c
, c
the c
friendship c
on c
such c
virtual c
world i
is c
so i
superficial c
which c
is c
not c
so i
relevant c
to c
the i
real-life c
. c

Also c
, c
as c
numerous c
profit-driven c
companies c
realize c
the i
hugh i
human c
traffic c
on c
such c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
they c
make c
it c
as c
a c
pond c
to c
fish c
the i
customers c
by c
uploading c
many c
advertisements c
. c

Furthermore c
this c
also c
possibly c
triggers c
the i
privacy c
issues c
as c
the i
Facebook c
allows c
some c
other c
profit-driven c
companies c
to c
have c
access c
to c
the c
information c
on c
the c
users c
. c

As c
this c
happens c
, c
users c
are c
more c
and c
more c
pron i
to c
any c
possible c
frauds c
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
are c
at c
their c
peaks c
at c
the c
moment c
, c
however c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
when c
people c
realize c
that c
such c
sites c
are c
not c
making c
them c
better c
persons c
in c
real-life c
, c
they c
will c
not c
be c
indulged c
in c
it i
as c
much c
as c
they c
are c
now c
. c

The c
users c
, c
soon c
, c
will c
realise c
that c
they c
do c
not c
need c
such c
social c
media c
sites c
to c
keep c
in c
contact c
with c
the i
their c
friends c
because c
, c
if c
they c
really c
need c
somebody c
, c
they c
will c
reach c
the i
friends c
no c
matter c
what c
. c

We c
think c
we c
are c
all c
connected c
through c
all c
sorts c
of c
social c
media c
, c
but c
do c
we c
really c
get c
connected c
or c
falling i
apart c
? c

Social c
media c
sites c
like c
Facebook c
and c
Twitter c
are c
born c
with c
the c
intention c
of c
connecting c
people c
, c
from c
around c
the c
world c
. c

The c
idea c
seems c
great c
, c
and c
nowadays c
most c
people c
even c
the c
older c
generation c
will c
have c
at c
least c
one c
social c
media c
platform c
like c
Facebook c
. c

The c
parents c
are c
now c
the c
" c
friends c
" c
of c
their c
kids c
, c
and c
they c
can c
now c
" c
follow c
" c
their c
kids c
more c
closely c
and c
on i
real c
time c
. c

People c
post c
about c
their c
random c
thoughts c
or c
daily c
activities c
via c
Twitter c
and c
post c
different c
kinds c
of c
photos c
on c
Facebook c
frequently c
, c
to c
be c
connected c
with c
their c
so c
called c
friends c
. c

However c
, c
as c
we c
then c
tend c
to c
spend c
too c
much c
time c
on c
this c
and c
have c
significantly c
reduced c
in i
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
, c
that c
eventually c
affects c
our c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

First c
and c
foremost c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
share c
on c
the c
advantages c
of c
using c
such c
social c
media c
in c
my c
daily c
life c
. c

As c
a c
student c
, c
I c
tend c
to c
meet c
lots c
of c
people c
from c
different c
background i
and c
at c
different c
settings c
. c

We c
may c
meet c
only c
once c
but c
we c
exchange c
our c
contact c
numbers c
as c
well c
as c
facebook c
account i
in c
order c
to c
keep c
in c
touch c
. c

Unlike c
just c
keeping c
contact c
numbers c
that c
we c
may c
not c
even c
call c
, c
social c
media c
like c
facebook c
is c
a c
great c
way c
for c
friends c
from c
different c
field i
or c
even c
from c
different c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
to c
be c
connected c
. c

Within c
clicks c
, c
we c
could c
check c
on c
the c
friend c
's c
profile c
and c
read c
on c
for c
his/her c
updates c
. c

On c
another c
hand c
, c
we c
could c
update c
our c
profile c
by c
posting c
on c
the c
wall c
and c
our c
friends c
could c
read c
up c
on c
the c
newsfeed c
. c

This c
allows c
friends c
that c
may c
not c
have c
the c
time c
for i
meet c
up c
to c
still c
connected i
in c
a c
way c
. c

Not c
only c
that c
, c
new c
friends c
can c
be c
easily c
met c
through c
such c
online c
platforms c
. c

Hence c
, c
our c
social c
circle c
is c
indeed c
expanding c
. c

Nonetheless c
, c
what c
seems c
to c
make c
us c
connected c
can c
be c
the c
cause c
that c
falls i
us c
apart c
. c

The c
obvious c
disadvantage c
of c
using c
social c
media c
is c
that i
the c
time c
reduction c
on c
face-to-face c
contact c
. c

This c
subsequently c
leads c
to c
the c
poor c
interpersonal c
skills c
that c
inhibit c
the c
growth c
of c
our c
real c
social c
circle c
. c

For c
example c
, c
we c
tend c
send i
a i
birthday c
wishes c
when c
Facebook c
promts i
us c
" c
Today c
is c
someone c
's c
birthday c
" c
. c

In c
fact c
, c
we c
may c
have c
just c
forgotten c
our c
friend c
's c
birthday c
. c

We c
used c
to c
send c
wishes c
cards c
during c
festive c
season c
like c
Chinese c
New c
Year c
, c
and c
we c
feel c
so c
good c
to c
write c
one c
and c
of c
course c
to c
receive c
one c
with c
stamps c
on c
it c
. c

Gone c
were i
the i
times c
, c
and c
now c
we c
do c
mass c
sending c
and c
the c
receiver c
may c
feel c
less c
meaning c
in c
such c
online c
wishes c
. c

As c
time c
passed i
, c
we c
may c
have c
more c
" c
friends c
" c
on c
the c
list c
, c
but c
the c
meaning c
of c
friends c
needs c
to c
be c
redefined c
. c

In c
a c
nutshell c
, c
every c
sword c
has c
two c
edges c
. c

The c
users c
of c
every c
social c
media c
sites i
need i
to c
strike c
a c
balance c
between c
the c
real c
world c
versus c
the c
virtual c
one c
. c

We c
should c
maximize c
the c
benefits c
of c
such c
platforms c
but c
be c
careful c
of c
its i
impacts c
on c
the c
actual c
life c
that c
we c
have c
. c

Ultimately c
, c
the c
best c
way c
to c
enhance c
interpersonal c
skills c
is c
still c
through c
face-to-face c
meetings c
but c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
only c
the c
tools c
to c
enhance c
it i
. c

Nowadays c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
commonly c
used c
in c
the i
society c
. c

I c
believe c
80 c
percents i
of c
people c
plays i
social c
media c
sites c
. c

These c
sites c
play c
the c
role c
of c
connecting c
people c
around c
the c
world c
. c

It i
consists i
of c
the c
function c
of c
connecting c
, c
sharing c
, c
interacting c
and c
advertising c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
also c
some c
disadvantages c
occur i
due c
to c
the c
social c
media c
which c
are c
concerned i
in c
the i
society c
. c

Therefore c
, c
this c
article c
is c
written c
to c
explain c
the c
pros c
and c
cons c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
our c
daily c
life i
. c

First c
, c
with c
the i
function c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
that c
connects i
the i
people c
, i
everyone c
is c
able c
to c
interact c
and c
communicate c
with c
friends c
and c
families c
, c
or c
even c
strangers c
without c
any c
time c
and c
place c
constraints c
. c

Through c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
we c
can c
chat c
with c
our c
friends c
who c
stay c
in c
Europe c
and c
New c
Zealand c
. c

There c
are c
over c
thousand i
miles c
between c
Singapore c
and c
these c
two c
countries c
. c

However c
, c
we c
are c
able c
to c
chat c
with c
our c
friends c
without c
travel i
to c
the c
countries c
. c

It c
saves c
a c
lot c
of c
money c
and c
time c
as i
well c
as c
strengthen i
our c
relationship i
although c
we c
stay c
at c
different c
places c
around c
the c
world c
. c

Besides c
that c
, c
company i
also c
can c
use c
the c
convenience c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
such c
as c
Facebook c
chat c
or c
Skype c
to c
facilitate c
the i
meeting i
with c
parties c
of c
project i
from c
around c
the c
world c
. c

Substantial c
cost i
is i
saved c
without c
the c
tiring c
travel c
from c
one c
point c
to c
another c
point c
. c

With c
the c
huge c
amount c
of c
cost c
savings c
, c
this c
capital c
can c
be c
utilized c
in c
the i
other c
sectors c
which c
benefits c
company i
more c
and c
boost i
up i
the i
company c
's c
profit c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
two i
sides c
of i
stories c
always i
. c

Some c
scholars c
argue c
that c
the c
usage c
of c
social c
media c
reduces c
the c
face-to-face c
connection c
between c
human i
. c

Since c
ancient c
times c
, c
human i
interact c
with c
others c
face c
by i
face c
. c

Without c
the i
facial c
impression i
, c
it c
is c
easier c
to c
misunderstand c
the i
intention i
of c
speakers c
. c

That c
is c
why c
facial c
impression i
is c
one c
of c
the c
most c
important c
elements c
in c
social c
learning c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
" c
social c
media c
sites c
will c
affect c
writing c
skills c
" c
, i
that i
is c
the c
point c
of c
view c
in c
society c
. c

Based c
on c
the i
statistic i
report c
, c
the i
more c
of c
the c
writing c
skills c
will i
be c
reduced c
when i
the c
more c
time c
used i
in c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

I c
believe c
most c
of c
us c
have c
the c
experience c
of c
suddenly c
forget i
how c
to c
write c
a c
word c
that c
we c
should c
know c
. c

The c
auto c
correction c
software c
is c
so c
effective c
when c
using c
electronic c
device i
until i
we c
did i
not c
realize c
the c
importance c
of c
writing c
. c

Writing c
is c
an c
essential c
skill c
of i
person i
who i
express c
their c
own i
feelings c
and c
opinions c
. c

'Privacy c
' c
, i
this c
is i
the c
word i
that c
popular c
in i
these c
few c
decades c
. c

Human i
has i
their c
own c
rights c
and c
privacy c
. c

I c
believe c
that c
most c
of c
us c
agree c
with c
these c
terms c
. c

However c
, c
there c
is c
news c
about c
the i
social c
media c
sites c
leaks i
users c
' c
information c
to c
companies c
with i
cash c
reimbursement c
. c

Everything c
we c
type c
in c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
is c
recorded c
in i
the c
server c
and c
then c
transfer i
to c
the i
companies c
for c
spying c
and c
advertising c
. c

Although c
it c
looks c
like c
no i
laws c
and c
it c
is c
your c
own c
space c
to c
speak c
and i
do c
anything c
you c
want c
, c
you c
are c
actually c
wrong c
. c

You c
are c
not c
only c
controlled c
by c
the c
government c
laws c
but c
also c
spied c
by i
the c
government c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
everything c
has c
two i
sides c
of c
stories c
. c

It c
is c
our c
responsibility c
to c
identify c
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

To c
utilize c
the c
technology c
well c
, c
we c
should c
do c
our c
effort i
to c
not c
only c
balance c
the c
pros c
and c
cons c
but c
also c
lengthen c
the c
pros c
and c
shorten c
the c
cons c
. c

Thus c
, c
the c
new c
technology c
will c
be c
able c
to c
bring c
a c
prosperous c
future c
for c
our c
and i
next c
generation c
. c

With c
the c
wide c
spread c
of c
advanced c
technology c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
becoming c
more c
and c
more c
popular c
. c

Getting c
connected c
on c
social c
media c
such c
as c
facebook c
and c
twitter c
has c
become c
a c
main c
trend c
as c
well c
as c
daily c
work c
nowadays c
. c

With c
this c
situation c
, c
both c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
apply c
to c
our c
daily c
life c
. c

On c
one c
side i
, c
it c
is c
obvioualy i
that c
many c
advantages c
have c
been c
brought c
to c
our c
lives c
. c

Social c
media c
provides c
people c
with c
the c
opportunity c
to c
get c
contact i
with c
each c
other c
every i
time c
and c
everywhere i
. c

Whether c
we c
are c
at c
home c
or c
at c
school c
, c
at c
work c
or c
on c
a i
holiday c
, c
we c
are c
able c
to c
communicate c
and c
interact c
with c
our c
friends c
. c

Even c
when c
people c
are c
thousands c
of c
miles c
apart c
, c
social c
media c
make c
it c
possible c
to c
have i
interaction c
by c
keep i
writing c
comments c
. c

When c
our c
phones c
are c
accidentally c
done i
, c
we c
can c
also c
use c
the c
social c
media c
to c
get c
contact i
with c
our c
friends c
. c

Some c
people c
who c
are c
try i
to c
talk c
in c
the i
public c
can c
also c
actively c
take c
part c
in c
the c
group c
chatting i
via c
social c
media c
. c

Besides c
, c
we c
can c
make c
more c
friends c
by c
such c
interactions c
when c
our c
friends c
also c
bring c
their c
friends c
in c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the c
popularity c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
have c
made c
it c
more c
convenient c
for c
people c
ot i
update c
friends c
' c
status i
and c
contact c
with i
friends c
more c
frequently c
. c

On c
the c
other c
side i
, c
we c
need c
to c
rethink c
about c
the c
influences c
brought c
by c
the c
social c
media c
. c

There c
are c
still c
many c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
. c

Firstly c
, c
interpersonal c
skills c
may c
be c
affacted c
by c
the c
reduction c
in c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
. c

While c
social c
media c
brings c
convenience c
to c
people c
life i
, c
people c
are c
more c
and c
more c
willing c
to c
use c
social c
media c
for c
chatting c
instead c
of c
face-to-face c
chatting c
which i
has c
a c
time c
and c
place c
requirement c
. c

People c
who c
are c
not c
good c
at c
public c
chatting c
may c
be c
more c
reluctant c
to c
talk c
to c
people c
, c
and c
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
can c
never c
be c
improved c
under i
this c
situation c
. c

Secondly c
, c
people c
's c
over-addition i
may c
avoidably c
, c
to c
some c
degree c
, c
exacerbate c
social c
alienation c
, c
and c
this c
kind c
of c
alienation c
causes c
some c
social c
media c
users c
to c
suffer c
from c
the c
over-dependence c
of c
virtual c
social c
networking c
. c

More c
and c
more c
networking c
has c
been c
transferred c
to c
internet c
from c
real c
life c
. c

This c
is c
a c
potential c
danger c
for c
teenagers c
who i
are c
growing c
with c
social c
changes c
to c
get c
hurt c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
a c
lot c
of c
updating c
of c
luxury c
living c
standard i
as i
well c
as c
other c
show-off c
situations c
may c
make c
people c
's c
daily c
life i
more c
and c
more c
grandiloquent i
, c
which c
is c
not c
an c
accurate c
social i
growing c
trend c
. c

Lastly c
, c
it c
is c
easy c
for c
people c
to c
waste c
a c
lot c
of c
time c
using c
social c
media c
. c

Again c
, c
there c
is c
a c
trend c
for c
them c
to c
suffer c
from c
social c
media c
addition i
and c
their c
study c
and c
work c
may c
be c
greatly c
influenced c
. c

Since c
we c
can c
see c
both c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
, c
and c
we c
can c
not c
deny c
the c
huge c
benefits c
that c
have c
been c
brought c
to c
us c
, c
this c
main c
trend c
of c
using c
social c
media c
may c
be i
still c
lasting c
for c
a c
long c
time c
. c

Therefore c
, c
everytime c
when i
we c
use c
social c
media c
, c
we c
should c
take c
both c
sides c
into c
consideration c
and c
try c
to c
avoid c
be i
affected c
by c
the c
disadvantages c
. c

Only c
by c
absorbing c
the c
essence c
and c
discarding c
the c
dregs c
can c
we c
make c
better c
use c
of c
the i
social c
media c
. c

In c
the i
sophisticated c
era c
like i
these c
days c
, c
experts c
keep c
producing c
inventions c
that c
are c
meant c
to c
make c
life c
easier c
. c

Geographical c
and i
transportation c
borders c
are c
not c
a c
problem c
anymore c
because c
communication c
and c
information c
technologies c
were i
enhanced c
continuously c
. c

Telephone c
may c
be i
perceived c
as c
a i
big i
innovation c
created c
ever c
when i
the c
first c
time c
Graham c
Bell c
introduced c
it c
. c

However c
, c
since c
internet i
were i
known c
, c
telephone c
started i
to c
give c
way c
to c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

Many c
advantages c
are c
given i
to c
the c
users c
. c

Let c
us c
take i
example i
from c
Facebook c
and c
Twitter c
, c
two c
of c
the c
most c
famous c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

Through c
Facebook c
, c
peope c
are c
able c
to c
maintain c
relationship i
with c
their c
old c
acquaintances c
. c

This c
benefit c
can c
not c
be c
obtained c
through c
telephone c
or c
mail c
because c
people c
's c
particular i
and c
address i
may c
change c
from c
time c
to c
time c
while i
on c
Facebook c
, c
people c
can c
keep c
in c
contact c
with c
old c
friends c
just c
by c
using c
name c
and c
photo c
, c
for c
example c
, c
as c
the c
identifier c
. c

Facebook c
is c
like c
a c
combination c
of c
message c
and c
chatting c
service c
, c
personal c
profile c
, c
media i
of c
sharing c
, c
and c
other c
entertainment c
add-on c
( c
i.e c
. c

social c
games c
) c
which c
allow i
users c
to c
communicate c
with c
remote c
people c
, c
and c
also c
to c
update c
and c
express c
themselves c
at c
the c
same c
time c
. c

Twitter c
, i
that c
has c
more c
simplified c
function i
compared c
to c
Facebook c
, c
gives i
more c
benefit c
if c
used c
as c
information c
sharing c
media c
. c

Twitter c
only c
allow i
users c
to c
give c
update i
that c
is i
limited c
to c
short c
sentences c
in c
order c
to c
spread i
the c
words c
fast i
, c
that i
only c
highlighted c
messages c
are c
delivered c
. c

For i
Facebook c
, c
a c
comprehensive c
way c
of c
sharing c
is c
offered c
since c
multiple c
photos c
and c
videos c
can c
be c
uploaded c
, i
long c
notes c
can c
be c
published c
, i
even c
documents c
and c
data c
can c
be c
shared c
through c
Facebook c
nowadays c
. c

These c
advantages c
also c
comes i
in c
handy c
as c
most c
of c
these c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
accessible c
through c
mobile c
application i
in c
our c
smartphones c
. c

Despite c
the c
luxury c
that c
is c
offered c
by c
social c
media c
, c
there c
are c
also c
harmful c
side c
effects c
which c
people c
may c
not c
realize c
it i
beforehand c
. c

Researches i
show i
that c
face-to-face c
meeting c
frequency c
among c
people c
that c
are c
addicted c
to c
social c
media c
sites c
has c
been c
decreasing c
. c

As c
the i
consequence c
, c
it i
affects c
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

People c
can c
think c
while c
typing c
and c
prepare c
what c
they c
want c
to c
say c
but c
in c
face-to-face c
communication c
, c
every c
word c
that c
comes c
out c
of c
your c
mouth c
and i
may c
be c
not c
well c
arranged c
is c
the i
picture i
of c
your c
personality c
. c

This c
skill c
requires c
practices i
and c
can c
not c
be c
done i
completely c
through c
social c
media c
. c

There c
is c
a c
situation c
where c
a c
family c
is c
having c
a c
dinner c
together c
in c
a c
restaurant c
but c
everybody c
is c
busy c
with c
their c
own c
gadget c
, c
posting c
picture i
in c
Facebook c
, c
updating c
status i
on c
Twitter c
, c
or c
even c
chatting c
with c
friends c
. c

These c
social c
media c
serves i
a c
purpose c
to i
bind c
people c
in c
spite c
of c
their c
geographical c
boundaries c
but i
it i
does i
n't c
mean c
that c
surrounding c
people c
are c
neglected c
as c
the c
payoff c
. c

This c
is c
related c
to c
the c
interpersonal c
skill i
that c
is i
mentioned c
before i
, i
that c
can i
be i
decreasing c
qualitatively c
if i
we c
are c
used i
to c
facing c
gadget i
, c
not c
facing c
human c
being i
. c

Another c
disadvantage c
that c
affects c
other c
people c
is c
that c
by c
only c
showing c
selected c
part i
of c
our c
lives c
, c
we c
build c
" i
false c
image c
" c
in c
public c
. c

We c
tend c
to c
only c
share c
our c
happy c
moments c
in c
media c
. c

Because c
of c
this c
, c
other c
people c
start c
to c
think c
that c
our c
lives c
are c
full c
of c
happiness c
with c
no c
problem i
at c
all c
. c

Other c
people c
then c
are c
influenced c
by c
us c
and c
tend c
to c
do c
the c
same c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
people c
think c
of c
theirselves i
lowly i
and c
may i
lead c
to c
depression c
and c
mental c
disorder c
. c

It c
also c
reduces c
our c
sympathy c
. c

This c
is c
a c
serious c
social c
problem c
and c
affects i
a c
lot c
of c
people c
. c

As c
explained c
above c
, c
modern c
and c
sophisticated c
technology c
does c
n't c
always c
give c
advantages c
. c

There c
are c
a c
lot c
of c
disadvantages c
that c
people c
may c
not c
realize c
of i
. c

It c
is c
up c
to c
people c
's c
discretion c
and c
comprehension c
to c
decide c
which i
side c
they c
want c
to c
take c
. c

So c
, c
we c
should c
never c
forget c
to c
think c
of i
and c
calculate c
the c
benefit c
and c
loss i
of c
every c
decision c
that c
we c
make c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
the c
advancement c
of c
technologies c
improves i
the c
life i
of c
many c
people c
a i
lot c
. c

In c
most c
of i
the i
countries c
, c
there c
is c
an c
emergence c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
such c
as c
Facebook c
and c
Twitter c
. c

Many c
people c
think c
that c
the i
social c
media c
sites c
have i
benefits c
on i
the i
communication c
between c
people c
while c
some c
others c
argue c
that c
there c
are c
several c
negative c
impacts c
for c
the i
society c
. c

One c
of c
the c
advantages c
which i
are c
carried c
by c
those c
social c
media c
sites c
is c
that c
they c
can c
connect c
us c
more c
closely c
than c
before c
. c

In c
the c
past c
decades c
, c
when c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
are i
not c
yet c
fully c
developed c
, c
people c
connect i
with c
others c
who c
live i
far c
away c
by c
using c
a c
phone c
, c
or c
even c
a c
letter c
. c

However c
, c
calling c
a c
person c
by c
using c
a c
phone c
and c
writing c
a c
person c
a c
letter c
require c
some c
cost c
, c
and c
sending c
a c
letter c
to c
a c
person c
who c
live i
far c
away c
, c
especially c
in c
villages c
, c
takes c
much i
time c
. c

The c
appearance c
of c
those i
social c
media c
sites c
causes i
those c
problems c
to i
be c
solved c
. c

People c
connecting c
through c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
can c
spend c
no c
money c
on c
the c
communication c
, c
and c
also c
take i
only c
one c
or c
a c
few c
seconds c
for c
the c
message c
to c
reach i
. c

Therefore c
, c
this c
advantage c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
saves c
money c
and c
time c
, c
and c
also c
provides c
convenience c
for c
many c
people c
. c

Moreover c
, c
this c
also c
provides c
an c
alternative c
way c
for c
people c
to c
contact c
a c
person c
whom c
they c
did c
not c
see c
for c
a c
very c
long c
time c
, c
such c
as c
their c
friends c
in c
primary c
school c
and c
secondary c
school c
. c

As c
we c
graduate c
from c
a c
school c
, c
we c
will i
probably c
lose c
contact c
with c
some c
of c
our c
friends c
. c

Some c
of c
them c
may c
have c
changed c
their c
phone c
numbers c
and c
addresses c
, c
and c
we c
are c
not c
able c
to c
find i
them c
through c
a c
phone c
or c
a c
letter c
. c

If c
phone i
and c
letter c
are i
the c
only c
way c
to c
contact i
them i
, c
we c
would c
probably c
not c
able i
to c
find c
them c
. c

Facebook c
and c
Twitter c
can c
serve c
as c
an c
alternative c
route c
to c
make c
connection c
between c
us c
and c
our c
old c
friends c
. c

Hence c
, c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
serves i
as c
a c
platform c
for c
the c
connection c
. c

Everything c
comes i
with c
benefits c
will i
also c
have c
their i
disadvantages c
. c

On i
the c
other c
hand c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
also c
bring c
some c
negative c
impacts c
for c
the i
people c
and c
the i
society c
. c

The c
advancement c
of c
those i
social c
media c
sites c
makes c
people c
so i
rely c
on c
them c
that i
some c
of c
them c
rather c
prefer c
using c
those c
sites c
to c
contact c
each c
other c
than c
talking c
to c
each c
other c
face c
to c
face c
. c

Many c
people c
argue c
that c
this c
is c
the c
most c
serious c
problem c
brought c
by i
social c
media c
sites c
. c

The c
usage c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
indirectly c
causes c
a c
reduction c
in c
face-to-face c
human c
communication c
in c
real c
life c
, c
which c
will i
in c
turn c
cause i
the c
lost i
of c
interpersonal c
skills c
for c
many c
people c
. c

As c
we c
all c
know c
, c
the i
interpersonal c
skills c
are c
essential c
for c
us c
to c
communicate c
with c
each c
other c
and c
to c
present c
our c
views c
and c
ideas c
. c

The c
lost i
of c
interpersonal c
skills c
results c
in c
the c
inability c
for i
people c
to c
well i
present c
their c
ideas c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
they c
will i
gradually c
decrease c
in c
their c
ability c
to c
compete c
with c
each c
other c
in c
the i
society c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
cause c
both c
positive c
and c
negative c
consequences c
for c
people c
and c
society c
. c

As c
a c
part c
of c
this c
modern c
society c
, c
we c
should c
learn c
to c
distinguish c
between c
good c
and c
bad c
impacts c
brought c
by i
the c
advancement c
of c
technologies c
, c
and c
also c
learn c
to c
avoid c
the c
cons c
and c
maximize c
the c
benefits c
of c
those c
sites c
. c

With c
the c
advancement c
of c
technology c
in c
recent c
years c
, c
the c
need c
to c
keep c
in-touch i
with c
people c
and c
latest i
news c
has c
become c
a c
tremendous c
demand c
. c

Some c
of c
the c
famous c
examples c
would c
be c
social c
media c
sites c
like c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
. c

With c
an c
increasing c
users i
of c
more c
than c
billion i
users i
from c
all c
over c
the c
world c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
have c
demonstrated c
clearly c
its i
success c
in c
playing c
an c
important c
part c
of c
our c
life i
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
arguments c
that c
social c
media c
life c
brings c
in i
a c
reduction c
in c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
, c
which c
in c
turn c
affects c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

Let c
's c
examine c
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
our c
daily c
life c
and c
society c
. c

First c
and c
foremost c
, c
all c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
free c
. c

All c
users c
' i
needs i
are c
an c
internet c
connection c
and c
an c
email c
account c
so c
that c
everyone c
can c
have c
a c
Facebook c
or c
Twitter c
ID c
to c
start c
their c
journey c
in c
social c
media c
life c
. c

Secondly c
, c
it c
helps c
people c
to c
keep c
in-touch c
with c
one c
another c
. c

Finding c
old c
friends c
through c
Facebook c
, c
for c
example c
, c
is c
more i
easier c
than c
asking c
people c
around c
in c
real c
life c
. c

Social c
media c
helps c
to c
lessen c
the c
hassle c
of c
geographical c
distance c
and c
brings c
people c
closer c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
keep c
us c
up-to-date c
on c
latest i
news c
and c
updates c
from c
almost c
everywhere c
in c
the c
world c
, c
all c
with c
a c
click c
away i
on c
the c
refresh c
button c
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
also c
link c
people c
together c
through c
allowing c
us i
to c
create c
our i
own c
groups c
, c
pages c
or c
sites c
to c
share c
our i
hobbies c
, c
interests c
and c
studies c
in c
particular c
subjects c
. c

Hence c
, c
it c
is c
undeniable c
that c
these c
sites c
play c
an c
important c
role c
in c
our c
global c
inter-connected c
world c
. c

However c
, c
social c
media c
sites c
also c
have c
its i
second c
side c
of c
negative c
impact c
on c
human i
. c

Undeniable i
, c
it c
becomes c
more c
addicting i
when c
we c
spend c
more c
time c
busy i
socialising c
and c
interacting c
virtually c
. c

We c
spend c
majority i
of c
our c
time c
on c
sites c
like c
Facebook c
, i
Twitter c
and c
it c
affects c
our c
daily c
work c
productivity c
and c
performance c
. c

In c
corporate i
world c
, c
employers c
often c
block c
social c
media c
network i
to c
prevent c
employees c
to i
spend c
their c
office c
time c
on c
their c
personal c
leisure c
than i
concentrating c
on c
their c
work c
. c

Using c
text-messaging c
language c
as c
an c
informal c
way c
of c
communicating c
on c
social c
media c
network i
also c
brings i
in c
a c
bad c
impact c
for c
us c
in c
a i
long c
term c
. c

The c
more c
time c
we c
spend c
on c
these c
sites c
, c
the c
lesser i
time c
we c
spend c
on c
face-to-face c
interacting i
with c
one c
another c
. c

Hence c
it c
lessens c
valuable c
interaction c
between c
human i
and c
time c
we c
spend c
away c
from c
the c
computer c
screen c
or c
mobile c
phone c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
there c
are c
also i
some c
false c
reports c
and c
fake c
IDs c
occur i
on c
both i
social c
media c
sites c
that c
people c
use c
fake i
ID c
to c
insult c
or c
harass c
someone c
, c
like c
the c
case c
of c
Heather c
Chua c
occurred i
recently c
on c
Facebook c
. c

These c
malicious c
comments c
often c
go c
viral c
and c
it c
creates c
a c
strong c
negative c
effect c
on c
the c
real c
user c
in c
real c
life c
, c
which c
might c
lead c
to c
unwilling i
attitude c
to c
interact c
with c
others c
in c
real c
life c
by c
the c
victim c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
everything i
has i
its i
two-sided c
affect c
and c
it i
depends c
on c
how c
we c
exploit c
it i
. c

With c
current i
booming c
technology c
, c
it c
is c
agreeable c
that c
people c
become c
more c
technology-savvy c
and c
they c
want c
to c
spend c
more c
time c
interacting c
with c
each c
others i
through c
social c
media c
sites c
, i
however i
, c
it i
does c
not c
mean c
that c
we c
should c
neglect c
face-to-face c
human c
interaction c
as c
it i
plays c
even i
a c
more c
important c
aspect c
in c
our c
life c
. c

As c
more c
and c
more c
social c
websites c
such c
as c
Twitter c
, c
Facebook c
and c
Weibo c
which i
have c
become c
ubiquitous c
, c
seamless c
and c
imperative c
in c
our c
life c
, c
people i
may i
worry c
about c
the c
young c
generation c
having c
problems c
in c
face-to-face c
communication c
skills c
. c

However c
, c
I c
believe c
that c
the c
benefits c
brought c
by c
these c
online c
chatting c
rooms c
tremendously c
outweigh c
their c
repercussions i
. c

Social c
media c
enables c
us c
to c
explore c
the c
world c
far c
far c
away c
without c
paying c
expensive c
airplane c
tickets c
and c
sparing c
a c
one-week c
holiday c
. c

The c
convenience c
is c
beyond c
description c
. c

With c
a c
small c
smart c
phone c
or c
a c
computer c
at c
school c
, c
at c
work c
or c
at c
home c
, c
we c
can c
easily c
make c
friends c
worldwide c
with c
a c
'click c
' c
and c
get c
to c
know c
about c
their c
life i
through c
having c
conversations c
with c
them c
, c
reading c
their c
blogs c
, c
photos c
and c
status i
. c

Compared c
to c
face-to-face c
interaction c
, c
online c
conversation c
is c
easier c
for c
strangers c
to i
open c
their c
mouth c
to c
each c
other c
. c

Since c
some c
of c
the c
information c
has c
already c
been c
revealed c
on c
the c
home c
page c
, c
it c
is c
also c
easier c
to c
find c
some c
common c
topics c
to c
talk c
about c
. c

Moreover c
, c
people c
usually c
like c
to c
share c
boldly c
about c
their c
real c
feelings c
online c
with c
their c
masks i
in c
reality c
being i
taken c

This c
has c
been c
indicated c
in c
a c
report c
done c
by c
Boston c
University c
in c
2012 c
, i
80 c
% c
of c
information c
posted c
online c
is c
true c
while c
a c
person c
may c
like i
3 c
out c
of c
10 c
times c
in c
real c
life c
. c

This c
shows c
that c
a c
facebook c
friend c
may c
know c
more c
about c
you c
than c
your c
close c
friend c
who c
does c
not c
have c
a c
facebook c
account c
. c

That c
is c
because c
we c
are c
acting i
who c
we c
are c
in c
reality c
while c
we c
have c
no c
reason c
to c
do c
that c
in c
the c
online c
virtual c
world c
. c

Although c
sometimes c
those i
genuine c
sharing c
of c
information c
may c
be c
inappropriate c
or c
even c
harmful c
, c
such c
as c
prevalent c
using i
of c
vulgarity c
and c
harsh-meaning c
comments c
, c
we c
can c
minimize c
those c
repercussions i
through c
strict c
regulations c
of c
content c
online c
. c

Another c
advantage c
of c
social c
media c
is c
in c
aiding c
the c
spread c
of c
democracy c
. c

People c
around c
the c
world c
could i
easily c
share c
their c
thoughts c
about c
their c
governments c
. c

That c
eliminates c
the c
incomplete c
information c
disadvantage c
for c
some c
remote c
rural c
regions c
where c
people c
are c
less c
aware c
of c
what c
actually c
is c
happening c
around c
them c
. c

One c
of c
the c
examples c
is c
the c
2012 c
riots c
happened i
in c
Egypt c
and c
Zambia c
. c

The c
idea c
of c
searching c
for c
democracy c
is i
passed c
from c
Egyptians c
to c
people c
in c
Zambia c
quickly c
through c
the c
use c
of c
social c
media c
. c

However c
, c
as c
the c
government c
controls c
most c
of c
the c
media c
. i

These i
social c
media c
may c
be c
tools c
of c
their c
campaign c
and c
manipulating i
the c
thoughts c
of c
the c
public c
. c

For c
example c
, c
in c
2012 i
general c
election c
is i
Singapore c
, c
Dr c
Tan c
Chee c
Keong c
made c
use c
of c
facebook c
to c
spread c
his c
campaign c
videos c
to c
the c
public c
. c

Though i
because c
of c
this c
, c
social c
media c
is c
still c
a c
much c
fairer c
and c
more c
transparent c
online c
platform c
for c
the c
public c
to c
share c
ideas c
compared c
to c
other c
traditional c
medias c
. c

Intensive c
use c
of c
Social c
media c
does c
reduce c
the c
time c
people c
spend c
in c
face-to-face c
communication c
. c

It c
is c
commonly c
seen c
in c
a c
food c
court c
or c
restaurant c
that c
a c
group c
of c
people c
sitting i
together c
around c
a c
table c
with c
each c
of c
them c
having c
a c
cell c
phone c
in c
their c
hands c
. c

They c
are c
too c
busy c
with c
their c
way c
too c
many c
virtual c
friends c
and c
some c
of c
them c
neglect c
the c
feelings c
of c
their c
real-life c
friends c
. c

In c
this c
case c
, c
I c
have c
to c
say c
that c
to c
err c
is c
human c
. c

What c
we c
can c
do c
is c
to c
educate c
the c
public c
about c
the c
importance c
of c
their c
friends c
just c
by c
their c
side c
and c
teach c
them c
to c
manage c
their c
time c
well c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
the c
use c
of c
social c
media c
has c
more c
advantages c
than c
disadvantages c
to c
our c
daily c
lifes i
. c

What c
we c
can c
do c
is c
to c
cautiously c
manage c
our c
time c
spent c
online c
and c
manage c
our c
words c
used c
online c
. c

With c
the c
regulation c
of c
government c
and c
relevant c
authorities c
, c
the c
virtual c
world c
would c
be c
a c
better c
world c
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
' c
role i
in c
connecting c
people c
around c
the c
world c
is c
undeniable c
. c

Thank i
to c
those c
social c
media c
, c
the i
communication c
among c
people c
all c
over c
the c
world c
is c
possible c
and c
can c
be c
done c
with c
ease c
. c

Apart c
from c
the c
ease c
of c
communication c
despite i
of c
the c
distance c
, c
many c
other c
advantages c
such c
as c
knowledge c
sharing c
and c
trades i
can c
be c
done c
through c
social c
media c
as c
well c
. c

Nevertheless c
, c
with i
those c
advantages c
, c
some c
disadvantages c
may c
appear c
such c
as c
reduction i
in c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
which c
affects c
interpersonal c
skills c
, c
privacy c
issue i
, c
as c
well c
as c
some c
frauds i
that c
can c
be c
done i
through c
social c
media c
. c

Twitter c
, c
Facebook c
and c
Skype c
are c
some c
social c
media c
sites c
which c
enable c
us c
to c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
our c
friends c
or c
family c
who c
are c
in c
other c
cities c
or c
countries c
. c

Through c
those i
sites c
we c
are c
able c
to c
talk c
to c
them c
, c
to c
know c
what c
their c
activities c
are c
and c
who c
their c
friends c
are c
, c
etc. c
From c
the i
surface i
point c
of c
view c
it i
is c
no c
doubt c
that c
these c
sites c
help c
us c
to c
have c
a c
better c
relationship c
with c
our c
relatives c
despite c
of i
the c
distance c
. c

The c
sharing c
of c
information c
can c
be i
done c
faster c
through c
social c
media c
as c
well c
, i
that i
is c
why c
nowadays c
many c
news c
publishers c
make c
their c
own c
social c
media c
account c
, i
for c
example c
Channel c
News c
Asia c
has c
a c
twitter c
account c
and c
will c
update c
its c
follower i
with c
headline c
news c
. c

That c
shows c
how c
actually i
news c
and c
information c
can c
be c
shared c
easily c
through c
social c
media c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
since c
many c
teenagers c
and c
young c
adults c
are c
fans c
of c
social c
media c
, c
these i
information c
can c
reach c
them c
easily c
without c
them i
need c
to c
watch c
or c
listen c
to c
the i
news c
reports c
. c

Due c
to c
the c
popularity c
of c
social c
media c
, c
many c
people c
start i
to i
do c
their i
business c
via c
these c
sites c
. c

More c
and c
more c
advertisements c
can c
be c
found c
on c
Facebook c
, i
whether i
it c
is c
our c
friends c
who c
sell c
their c
products c
or c
professional c
brands c
selling c
their c
products c
online c
, c
we c
can c
get i
to c
buy i
and c
contact c
the c
sellers c
through c
those c
sites c
, c
which c
can c
be c
considered c
as c
an c
advantage c
for c
us c
, c
the c
buyers c
. c

However c
, c
is c
it c
the c
same c
when c
we c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
someone c
virtually c
compared c
to c
when c
we c
meet c
them c
personally c
? c

I c
do c
think c
there c
is c
difference i
in c
it c
and c
I c
believe c
many c
of c
us c
will c
agree c
. c

When c
we c
write c
or c
communicate c
virtually c
, c
we c
can c
hide c
our c
through i
feelings c
and c
many i
not c
become i
ourselves c
since c
we c
do c
not c
want c
the c
other c
party c
to c
judge c
us c
. c

Other c
than c
that c
, c
sometimes c
the c
message c
of c
one c
party c
can c
not c
be c
delivered c
properly c
to c
the c
other c
one i
since c
the c
communication c
is c
done c
through c
written c
language c
, c
and c
thus c
the c
'tone c
' c
of c
the c
message c
sent c
and c
when c
it c
is c
received c
may c
be c
different c
. c

Many c
people c
are c
very c
brave c
in c
telling c
people c
about c
their c
opinions c
online c
but c
in c
real c
life c
some c
of c
them c
can c
be c
very c
shy c
and c
not c
outspoken c
at c
all c
. c

This c
will c
lead c
to c
a i
bad c
inter-personal c
skill i
as c
well c
as c
a c
problem c
of c
trusts i
. c

Nowadays c
we i
can c
not c
really c
trust c
new c
people c
whom c
we c
know c
from c
social c
media c
since c
we c
will c
never c
know c
whether c
they c
are c
even c
'real' c
. c

Some c
people c
fake c
their c
identities c
in c
media c
sites c
so c
that c
they c
can c
know c
more c
people c
or c
some c
may c
even c
cheat c
others c
. c

In c
addition c
, c
privacy i
issue c
has c
become c
more c
popular i
nowadays c
since c
some i
people c
do i
not c
realize c
that c
they c
may c
actually c
share c
some c
information c
that c
they c
are c
not c
willing c
to c
share c
at i
the c
first c
place c
. c

Therefore c
, c
while c
social c
media c
sites c
are i
undoubtedly c
have c
benefits c
in c
our c
life c
, c
we c
should c
consider c
its i
drawbacks c
and c
thus c
use c
it i
wisely c
so c
that c
we c
can c
gain c
more c
of c
their c
benefits c
and c
it i
disadvantages c
us c
in c
the c
smallest c
way c
as i
possible c
. c

It c
is c
a c
common c
scene c
that i
almost c
everyone c
in c
a i
public c
transport c
is i
watching i
at c
phone i
or c
wearing c
a i
pair i
ear c
piece c
in c
this c
modern c
society c
today c
. c

Not c
only c
one c
but c
many c
developed c
and c
developing c
countries c
have c
the c
same c
picture i
. c

Some c
say c
that c
it c
is c
a c
necessary c
step c
for c
human c
revolution i
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
like c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
are c
popular c
among c
people c
in c
order c
for c
them c
to c
connect c
to c
others c
even c
from c
different c
countries c
. c

It i
also c
brings i
many c
negative c
effects c
such c
as c
loss c
of c
face-to-face c
communicating c
skills c
which c
is c
important c
in c
their i
working i
place c
. c

This c
essay c
will c
discuss c
about i
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
our c
daily c
life i
. c

One c
of c
the c
significant c
advantages c
of c
using c
a c
popular c
social c
media c
site c
is c
that c
people c
can c
reach c
other i
easily c
, c
even c
without i
contact i
for c
a c
long c
time c
. c

In c
this i
fast c
pace c
and i
competitive c
world c
, c
people c
may c
not c
able i
to c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
others c
. c

With c
the c
help c
of c
social c
media c
site i
, c
people c
are c
able c
to c
upload c
their c
new c
discoveries c
and i
funny c
scene i
on i
it i
and c
they i
can c
be c
updated c
the c
new c
information c
of i
their c
friends c
. c

Personally c
I c
am c
study i
in i
oversea i
, i
busy i
study c
life c
keeps c
me c
away c
from c
contact c
my i
old c
friend i
. c

Using c
a c
common c
social c
media c
site c
with c
my c
friends c
to i
help c
me c
know c
what c
are i
their c
statuses c
nowadays c
. c

And i
I c
am c
able c
to c
easily c
find c
a c
common c
topic c
when c
I c
contact c
them c
. c

In c
Singapore c
, c
many c
Malaysian i
cross c
the c
sea c
to c
work c
here c
. c

Many c
of c
them c
are c
busy c
in i
work i
and c
separate i
with i
their c
children c
. c

One c
of c
Manager i
in c
my c
working i
place c
has c
the c
same c
situation c
. c

After c
my c
Manager c
taught c
her c
mother c
how c
to c
use c
Facebook c
, c
she c
was c
able c
to c
upload c
video c
clips c
of c
her c
grandchild c
. c

Therefore c
my c
Manager c
would c
not c
miss c
the c
moments c
of c
her c
daughter c
's c
growth c
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
are c
also c
a c
very c
useful c
tool c
for c
people c
to c
start c
a i
new c
friendship i
or c
relationship i
. c

People c
get i
connected c
or c
closer c
with c
same c
preferences c
. c

It c
is c
easier c
for c
people c
to c
approach c
the i
other c
after c
knowing i
the c
information c
. c

Students c
can c
exchange c
their c
experiences c
in i
study i
even c
they i
are c
in c
different c
countries c
. c

People c
are c
able c
to c
share c
the i
culture i
or i
pretty c
photos c
online c
, i
therefore i
others c
can c
spread c
the i
joy c
with i
them i
. c

Thus c
I c
believe c
that c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
one c
of c
useful i
tool i
to c
help c
people c
known i
each c
other c
better c
. c

However c
, c
social c
media c
site i
is i
a i
double-sided i
sword c
, i
it i
also c
bring c
in i
some c
negative c
effect i
on c
our c
daily c
life i
. c

One c
of c
the c
disadvantage i
that c
many c
people c
concerns i
is c
that c
people c
loss i
the i
interest c
of i
face-to-face c
communication c
. c

Many c
people c
like c
to c
use c
language i
to c
pretend i
themselves c
, c
and c
lost i
confidence c
when c
they c
talk c
to c
each c
other c
. c

Although c
not c
everyone c
is c
good c
at c
public c
relationship i
even c
without c
the c
existence c
of c
the i
social c
media c
sites c
, c
we c
can c
not c

do c
affect c
some c
people c
in c
their c
ability i
of c
interpersonal c
skills c

In c
conclusion c
, c
the i
shadow c
always c
exists c
when i
there c
is c
light c
. c

We c
should c
take c
the i
advantages i
of c
the c
creatures c
we c
create c
and c
try c
to c
avoid c
the c
negative c
effects c
. c

Social c
media c
sites c
suppose i
be c
a i
very c
useful c
and c
convenient c
tool i
to c
use i
and i
bring c
people c
get i
closer c
in i
this c
globalised c
world c
. c

The c
use c
of c
social c
media c
has c
largely c
influenced c
our c
ways c
in c
communicating c
with c
one c
another c
. c

Online c
friends c
became i
real c
life c
friends c
and c
real c
life c
friends c
communicate c
with c

online c
. c

Social c
media c
has c
changed c
our c
ways c
of c
exchanging c
information c
and c
interpersonal c
relationships c
profoundly c
. c

There c
are c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
in c
this c
change c
. c

Social c
media c
has c
reshaped c
the i
way c
of c
communication c
. c

In c
real c
life c
, c
we c
communicate c
with c
one c
another c
as c
equal c
participants c
. c

We c
share c
ideas c
, c
stories c
and c
forge c
friendship i
based c
on c
mutual c
respect c
. c

However c
, c
communication c
on c
social c
media c
is c
largely c
based c
on c
" c
broadcasting c
and c
listening c
" c
. c

When c
we c
use c
facebook c
and c
post c
pictures c
and c
statuses c
. i

We i
are c
actively c
" c
presenting c
" c
fa c
ç c
ades c
of c
our c
lifes c
in c
front c
of c
others c
. c

We c
tend c
to c
post c
pictures c
with c
the c
best c
looks c
, i
status c
that c
are c
funny c
. c

We c
broadcast c
these c
facades c
of c
us c
to c
others c
. c

The c
images c
we c
choose c
to c
present c
are c
tentatively i
considered c
. c

The c
audience c
is c
not c
some c
specific c
person c
, c
but c
everyone c
we c
might c
know c
, c
or c
even c
the c
entire c
world c
. c

There c
is c
an c
element c
of c
seeking c
out i
for c
attention c
rather c
than c
expressing c
one c
's c
true c
opinion c
on c
social c
networks c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
the c
viewers c
, c
are c
not c
the c
listeners c
. c

They c
are c
just c
scrolling c
down c
pages c
of i
pages c
of c
pictures c
and c
statuses c
and c
see c
one c
of c
them c
which c
they c
might c
think c
it i
funny c
. c

It c
is c
not c
the c
broadcasters c
themselves c
they c
care c
about c
, c
but c
the c
content c
. c

This c
type c
of c
communication c
does c
not c
help c
forging i
interpersonal c
relationships c
. c

In c
real c
life c
, c
establishing c
friendship i
requires c
the c
all-rounded c
understanding c
in i
one c
another c
and c
the i
caring c
for c
one c
another c
. c

The c
latter c
requires c
face c
to c
face c
interaction c
where c
we c
can c
show c
our c
emotions c
to c
the i
other c
. c

One c
can c
not c
truly c
understand c
a c
person c
with i
only c
stalking c
his/her c
facebook c
page c
where c
he/she c
carefully c
chooses c
what c
to c
present c
. c

One c
can c
not c
truly c
show c
their c
emotions c
by c
another c
by c
texting c
some c
= c
) c
signs c
. c

The c
broadcasting c
and c
viewing c
model c
is c
not c
good c
for c
forging c
relationships c
. c

However c
, c
it c
is c
good c
for c
sharing c
information c
. c

On c
social c
media c
, c
everyone c
is c
a c
broadcaster c
and c
a c
viewer c
. c

With c
my c
social c
network c
account c
, c
I c
seldom c
read c
newspapers c
or c
go c
to c
news c
websites c
anymore c
; c
because c
I c
can c
easily c
read c
them c
from c
the c
status c
of c
my c
friends c
. c

If c
I c
am c
interested c
in c
politics c
, c
I c
can c
just c
follow c
some c
politics i
newspapers c
or c
public c
figures c
. c

I c
get c
news c
for c
sales c
, c
clothes c
and c
cosmetics c
from c
my c
friends c
. c

If c
some c
of c
my c
friends c
have c
horrible c
taste c
on i
clothes c
and c
he/she c
posts c
them c
often c
, c
I c
can c
simply c
block c
him/her c
off c
. c

Information c
got i
circulated c
. c

The c
most c
popular c
information c
get i
circulated c
the c
most c
so c
I c
can c
seldom c
miss c
it c
. c

Social c
network c
plays c
a c
role c
in c
providing c
and c
also c
filtering c
information c
. c

This c
saves c
a c
lot c
of c
time c
for c
me c
in c
reading c
newspapers c
and c
watching c
TV c
. c

Personally c
I c
feel c
more c
at c
ease c
on c
social c
medias c
. c

From c
the c
above c
two c
points c
of c
view c
I c
think c
social c
media c
could c
forge c
more c
interest-based c
friendships c
. c

With c
the c
help c
of c
social c
media c
, c
I c
become c
real c
life c
friends c
with c
those c
from c
online c
forums c
whom c
I c
share c
the c
same c
interest i
with c
. c

I c
also c
discover c
some c
of c
my c
friends c
' c
interest i
which c
I c
find c
common c
with i
myself c
so c
that c
talking c
to c
one c
another c
is c
much c
more c
about c
life c
, c
study c
, c
friends c
, c
etc c
. c

The c
communication c
does c
not c
focus c
on c
how c
we c
feel c
, i
or c
to c
say c
, c
each c
otherm c
, c
but c
whatever c
is c
interesting c
, c
or c
the c
content c
. c

In c
this c
case c
, c
interpersonal c
skill i
is i
not c
as c
important c
because c
our c
goal c
is c
not c
to c
impress c
somebody c
, c
but c
to c
get c
the c
information c
that c
we c
are c
both c
interested c
in c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
I c
think c
social c
media c
has c
reshaped c
interpersonal c
relationships c
from c
a c
more c
human-based c
friendship c
that c
requires c
sharing c
and c
caring c
between c
friends c
, c
to c
a c
more c
information-based c
friendship c
that c
requires c
a c
mutual c
interest c
. c

There c
are c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
in c
itself i
, c
however c
, c
whether c
it c
is c
good c
or c
bad c
we c
are c
still c
not c
sure c
. c

It c
is c
just c
different c
. c

Advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
daily c
life c

People c
that i
living c
in c
the c
modern c
world c
really c
can c
not c
live c
without c
the i
social c
media c
sites c
like c
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
. c

Almost c
all c
students c
and c
young c
adults c
possess c
the i
Facebook c
or c
Twitter c
account c
. c

It c
is c
true c
that c
social c
media c
makes i
people c
be i
able c
to c
connect c
one i
another c
more c
conveniently c
. c

However c
, c
it c
seems c
that c
, c
especially c
for c
some c
those i
, c
sharing i
some c
parts c
of c
their c
lives c
such c
as c
videos c
and c
photos c
on c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
become i
really c
necessary c
. c

An c
extremely c
interesting c
and c
ironic c
phenomenon c
was c
discovered c
that i
a c
group c
of c
friends c
met c
and c
sat c
around c
one i
table c
, c
but c
none c
of c
them c
were c
really c
chatting c
with c
one c
another c
. c

Instead c
, c
all c
of c
them c
were c
more c
interested c
in c
posting c
pictures c
of c
this c
" c
cheerful c
" c
meeting c
on c
their c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

Therefore c
, c
there c
is c
need c
to c
discuss c
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
social c
media c
. c

Social c
media c
enables c
people c
from c
different c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
to c
communicate c
with c
one c
another c
. c

People c
used c
to c
write c
letters c
and c
send c
post c
cards c
to c
keep c
in c
touch c
with c
ones i
live c
far c
away c
from c
them c
in c
the c
past c
. c

It c
can i
take c
a c
few c
days c
or c
weeks c
for i
those i
to c
receive c
the i
messages c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
what i
people c
need c
to c
do c
is c
just i
typing i
in c
front c
of c
the c
computer c
in c
their c
own c
rooms c
. c

And c
people c
on c
the c
other c
side i
will c
only c
need c
a c
second c
to c
receive c
the c
message c
. c

Distance c
and c
time c
are c
no c
longer c
the i
problems c
, c
which c
is c
convenient c
especially c
when c
instant c
chat c
is c
needed c
. c

However c
, c
when c
people c
become c
more c
and c
more c
addicted c
to c
this c
convenience c
and c
fail c
to c
communicate c
with c
people c
who c
are c
close c
to c
them c
, c
their c
face-to-face c
interpersonal c
skills c
are c
lost c
. c

Social c
media c
provides c
people c
a i
way c
of c
talking c
and c
chatting c
which c
can c
never c
be c
considered c
as c
a c
way c
of c
communication c
. c

When c
ones i
chat c
on c
those c
media c
sites c
, c
there c
is c
no c
eye c
connection c
, c
no c
emotion i
delivery c
and c
even c
the i
expressions c
are c
typed c
in c
by c
using c
some c
combinations c
of c
punctuations c
. c

For c
more c
convenience c
, c
sentences c
are c
shortened c
to c
simply c
three c
or c
four c
words c
such c
as c
lol c
( c
which c
means c
laugh c
intensively c
) c
and c
" c
asap c
" c
( c
which c
means c
as c
soon c
as c
possible c
) c
. c

People c
indeed c
go c
to c
great c
length c
to c
make c
their c
words c
as c
shorter c
as c
they c
can c
. c

While c
, c
once c
they c
are i
communicating c
with c
people c
in i
their c
face c
, c
expressing c
themselves c
appropriately c
become i
really i
a c
big c
problem c
. c

Social c
media c
also c
provides i
people c
huge i
brunch c
information c
about c
people c
and c
things c
that c
they i
interests i
. c

For c
example c
, c
on c
Twitter c
, c
it c
is c
exciting c
to c
follow c
people c
that c
you c
adore c
like c
famous c
movie c
and c
series c
stars c
, c
business c
men c
and c
entrepreneurs c
. c

It c
makes c
people c
feel c
extreme i
close c
to c
their c
admirers c
' c
lives c
and c
works c
. c

Updated c
news c
people c
care c
about c
can c
be c
easily c
obtained c
when c
you c
refresh c
your c
social c
media c
sites c
on c
your c
smart c
phones c
and c
laptops c
almost i
every c
time c
at c
any c
time c
. c

However c
, c
after c
one c
has c
registered c
in i
those c
social c
media c
sites c
which c
are c
not c
reliable c
, c
all c
the c
information c
you c
have c
filled c
in c
will c
be c
a c
weapon c
against c
you c
in c
the c
future c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
not c
everyone c
on c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
is c
honest c
. c

The c
profile c
picture c
may c
not c
be c
the c
person c
who c
that c
user c
says c
he c
or c
she c
really c
is c
. c

The c
reason c
might c
just c
be c
that c
he c
or c
she c
just c
wants c
to c
" c
decorate c
" c
his c
or c
her c
face c
. c

But c
there c
is c
possibility c
that c
the c
person c
on c
the c
other c
side c
is c
deceiving c
you c
in c
order c
to c
obtain c
your c
information c
against i
you c
. c

No c
pledge c
of c
authenticity c
risks i
people c
's c
information c
and c
privacy c
that i
are c
shared c
on c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
, c
social c
media c
has c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
in c
people c
's c
daily c
life i
. c

It c
shortens c
the c
distance c
between c
people c
from c
all c
over c
the c
world c
and c
makes c
instant c
communication c
possible c
. c

And c
it c
becomes c
more c
convenient c
to c
obtain c
and c
update c
information c
by c
using c
social c
media c
. c

On c
the c
contrary c
, c
social c
media c
makes c
people c
lose c
their c
ability c
to c
communicate c
effectively c
in c
their c
real c
lives c
and c
makes c
people c
risk c
exposing c
their c
privacy c
to c
those c
whose c
identity c
can c
not c
be c
verified c
on c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

How c
do c
social c
media c
help c
change c
our c
lives c
? c

As c
the c
development c
of c
the i
technology i
, c
social c
media c
becomes i
more i
and c
more c
significant c
role c
in c
the c
whole i
world c
. c

Everyone i
in c
the c
world c
can c
not i
stop c
using c
it c
every c
day c
to c
express c
their c
feelings c
or c
ideas c
and c
a i
log c
of c
other c
stuff c
which c
helps c
their c
friends c
know c
their i
lives c
better c
. c

However c
, c
it c
also c
raised i
the i
concerns c
about c
whether c
it c
brings c
us c
more c
benefits c
or c
a c
human c
disaster c
. c

Although c
it c
helps c
to c
connect c
us c
with c
our c
friends c
wherever c
we c
are c
, c
it c
at i
the c
same c
time c
reduces c
the c
chance c
for c
us c
to c
talk c
to c
our c
friends c
face c
to c
face c
which c
may c
affect c
our c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

Thus c
, c
whether c
there c
are c
more c
advantages c
or c
disadvantages c
becomes c
a c
tough i
question c
for c
every c
human c
being c
. c

Many c
people c
says i
they c
will i
support c
the i
social c
media c
since c
it c
really c
helps c
them c
to c
have c
a c
closer c
view i
about c
how c
their c
friends c
are c
going c
in c
other c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
. c

This c
is c
especially c
to i
people c
who c
are c
overseas c
. c

To c
them c
, c
social c
media c
is c
the c
only c
resource c
they c
can c
approach c
to c
know c
everything c
happened i
in c
their c
home c
country i
and c
the c
way i
they c
can c
use c
to c
show c
their c
lives c
to c
their c
lovers c
as c
well c
. c

What c
's c
more c
, c
these c
days c
social i
media c
plays c
an c
important c
role c
in c
spreading c
the i
information c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
people c
can c
just i
easily c
put c
their c
renting i
information c
on c
their c
facebook c
account c
and c
wait c
for c
the i
response c
from c
others c
who c
are c
from c
different c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
which i
brings c
us c
a c
huge c
amount c
of c
convenience c
. c

It c
is c
quite c
significant c
especially c
for c
those i
young c
teenagers c
since c
they c
would c
rather c
go c
to c
these c
sites c
to c
see c
the i
news c
and c
know i
what c
happened i
in c
this i
world c
than i
read c
the c
newspaper c
every c
day c
. c

However c
, c
there c
are c
also c
a c
great c
amount c
of c
people c
who c
against i
this c
technology c
. c

They c
worry c
a c
lot c
about c
the c
bad c
effect c
on c
the i
teenagers c
who c
are c
still c
developing c
themselves i
. c

They c
pointed i
that c
actually c
social c
media c
reduces c
the c
chance c
for c
us c
to c
talk c
to c
people c
around c
us c
face c
to c
face c
. c

The c
more c
we c
care c
about c
facebook c
, c
the c
less c
time c
we c
will i
have c
to c
spend c
with c
our c
friends c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
it c
is c
quite c
common c
to c
see c
on i
some c
party c
, c
people c
would i
more c
prefer c
looking c
at c
their c
phones c
and c
reading c
all c
the c
posts c
on c
facebook c
if c
they c
feel c
bored c
. c

It c
makes c
people c
worry c
since i
if c
all c
the i
teenagers c
continue c
using c
social c
media c
frequently c
, c
they i
will c
decrease c
the c
ability c
to c
talk c
to c
people c
. c

They c
will c
feel c
it c
becomes i
difficult c
for i
them i
to c
find c
any c
topics c
to c
communicate i
with c
other c
people c
. c

Personally c
, c
I c
strongly c
agree c
that c
social c
media c
brings c
more c
disadvantages c
compared c
to c
advantages i
it c
gives c
us c
. c

Although c
it c
is c
really c
useful c
when c
we c
need c
to c
use c
it c
to c
let c
other c
people c
know c
we c
really c
live c
a c
good c
life c
, c
it c
wastes c
us i
a c
lot c
of c
time c
as c
well c
. c

Think i
in c
another c
way c
, c
if c
we c
put i
those i
time c
we c
spend i
on i
wandering i
on c
those c
sites c
, i
we c
may i
already c
finish c
one c
book i
or c
do c
other c
more c
meaningful c
things c
. c

We c
should c
keep c
in c
mind c
that c
there c
are c
still c
ways c
for c
us c
to c
contact c
with i
our c
family c
or c
friends c
. c

Everything i
will i
be c
bad c
if c
we c
do c
n't c
know c
how c
to c
use c
them i
wisely c
no c
matter c
whether c
it c
is c
really c
good c
or c
not c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
it c
is c
important c
for c
people c
to c
know c
that c
we c
need c
to c
be c
cautious c
about c
the c
time c
we c
spend c
on c
these c
social c
media c
. c

As c
stated c
above c
, c
I c
strongly c
believe c
that c
if c
we c
can c
use c
social c
media c
wisely c
rather c
than c
abusing c
it c
, c
we c
will c
all c
live c
a c
better c
life c
. c

The c
advantage c
and c
disadvantage c
of c
social c
media c

Nowadays c
, c
as c
the c
technology c
is c
becoming c
increasingly c
advanced c
, c
more c
and c
more c
social c
media c
sites c
are c
showing c
up c
in c
our c
daily c
life c
. c

You c
can c
see c
people c
playing c
Facebook c
, c
Twitter c
through i
their c
smart c
phones c
or c
ipad c
on c
buses c
or c
on c
trains c
. c

Some c
may c
say c
that c
the c
appearance c
for i
these c
modern c
media c
will i
reduce c
the c
chance c
for c
people c
to c
communicate c
face c
to c
face c
. c

This c
essay c
will c
illustrate c
the c
pros c
and c
cons c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
modern c
society c
. c

Firstly c
of c
all c
, c
social c
media c
can c
make c
it c
more c
convenient c
for c
people c
to c
make c
friends c
and c
contact c
each c
other c
. c

Years c
ago c
when c
these c
modern c
products c
have i
not c
been c
popular c
, c
the c
way c
for c
people c
to c
communicate c
or c
contact c
people c
far c
way c
are i
still i
restricted c
in i
making c
phone c
calls c
, c
sending c
emails c
or c
writing c
letters c
. c

Some c
will i
take c
long i
time c
and c
some c
are i
not c
efficient c
enough c
for c
people c
to c
get c
their c
response c
. c

However c
, c
social c
media c
solves c
these c
problems c
well c
. c

People c
can c
contact c
their c
friends c
on c
the c
internet c
and c
get c
their i
reply c
very c
fast c
. c

The c
communication c
is c
also c
not c
limited c
in c
words c
. c

People c
can c
express c
themselves c
through c
pictures c
or c
emotions c
. c

People c
can c
also c
get c
to c
know c
their c
friends i
' c
state c
and c
mood c
by c
looking c
at c
their c
posts c
on c
line c
. c

Moreover c
, c
people c
can c
be c
aware c
of c
what c
is c
going c
on c
in c
social i
situation c
and c
see c
the c
comments c
online c
and c
share c
their c
opinions c
on c
these c
websites c
. c

These c
social c
media c
makes i
people c
's c
life i
much c
more c
colorful c
and c
provide c
a c
lot c
of c
fun c
. c

However c
, c
social c
media c
may c
do c
some c
harm c
to c
people c
's c
life i
. c

It i
will i
make c
people c
spend c
more c
time c
on i
chatting c
on c
the c
internet c
rather c
than c
communicate i
face c
to c
face c
such c
that c
the i
interpersonal c
skill i
will i
be c
badly c
affected c
. c

Some c
people c
spend c
a c
lot c
of c
time c
in i
it c
and c
forget c
their c
real c
life i
. c

Actually c
, c
I c
have c
seen c
some i
people c
are i
very c
funny c
and c
interesting c
when c
I c
am c
chatting c
with c
them c
online c
. c

However c
, c
they c
behave i
quite c
boring c
when c
I c
talk c
to c
them c
in c
real c
life c
. c

Teenagers c
are i
developing i
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
and c
social c
skills c
when c
they c
are c
growing c
up c
. c

If c
they c
spend c
too c
much c
time c
on c
these c
social c
media c
, c
it c
may c
cause c
some c
problems c
to c
their c
mental c
development c
. c

They c
may c
feel c
uncomfortable c
when c
they c
communicate c
with c
people c
face c
to c
face c
. c

Some c
may c
share c
fewer i
and c
fewer c
time c
with c
their c
family c
and c
not c
knowing i
how c
to c
express c
themselves c
. c

Moreover c
, c
some c
wrong c
values c
on c
the c
websites c
will c
affect c
teenagers c
and c
confuse c
them c
. c

Some c
may c
even c
do c
something c
wrong c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
the c
showing c
up c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
is c
a c
double c
edged c
sword c
. c

It c
can c
make c
our c
life c
simpler c
. c

People c
can c
promote c
their c
friendship i
and c
relationship i
through c
these c
social c
media c
. c

Whereas i
, c
it i
can c
also c
make c
people c
forget c
to c
communicate c
to c
their c
family c
and c
friends c
in c
the i
real c
life c
and c
affect c
negatively c
to i
their c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

But c
overall c
, c
the c
advantages c
far c
outweigh c
its i
disadvantage i
. c

So c
we c
need c
to c
make c
best c
use c
of c
these c
social c
media c
and c
make c
it i
a c
fun c
way c
of c
adding i
some c
excitement c
when c
life c
is c
boring c
. i

And i
try c
to c
bypass c
the c
shortcomings c
. c

Remember i
to c
send c
greetings c
to c
our c
friends c
and c
family c
frequently c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
with c
the c
advancement c
of c
technology c
, c
it c
is c
easy c
to c
communicate c
wherever c
you c
are c
. c

The c
appearance c
of c
social c
media c
sites c
truly c
connects c
people c
closely c
. c

People c
can c
know c
their i
friends c
' c
recently i
looks c
and c
interesting i
things c
happens i
on i
that c
people c
just c
by c
checking c
their c
facebook c
or c
other c
social c
media c
sites c
. c

We c
can c
not c
deny c
that c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
truly c
make i
the c
old c
friends c
do i
not c
lose c
the i
information c
and c
the c
chances i
to c
communicate c
with c
you c
even c
you i
are c
in c
a c
different c
country c
. c

However c
, c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
truly c
reduce c
the c
communication c
in c
face-to-face i
which c
truly c
affects c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

There c
are c
two c
advantages c
and c
two c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
the i
social c
media c
in c
people c
's c
daily c
life i
. c

Firstly c
, c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
can c
connect c
people c
with c
their c
friends c
and c
parents c
closely c
. c

By c
typing c
the i
words c
and c
showing c
the i
pictures c
, c
people c
can c
express c
their i
emotions c
that c
they c
are i
too c
shy c
to c
express c
. i

For c
example c
, c
on c
mother c
's c
day c
, c
people c
are i
shy c
to c
say c
" c
I c
love c
you c
" c
to c
their c
mothers c
so c
they c
can c
type c
it c
on c
his i
or c
her c
mother c
's c
facebook c
page i
. c

Then c
his i
or c
her c
mother i
will c
also c
know i
the i
emotion c
and c
feel c
warm c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
when c
the i
teenager c
is i
studying c
in c
a c
foreign c
country c
, c
the c
internet c
is c
the c
only c
way c
that c
he i
can c
communicate c
with c
their c
parents c
and c
friends c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the c
social c
media c
is c
truly c
good c
for c
people c
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
social c
media c
sites c
can c
not c
only c
connect c
people c
with c
their c
friends c
closely c
. c

People c
can c
also c
know i
much i
information c
about c
the i
celebrity c
in i
Twitter c
and c
Facebook c
such c
as c
Obama c
, i
Bill c
Gates c
and c
get c
the i
first-hand c
study c
materials c
on c
it i
. c

They c
can c
learn c
how c
these c
people c
succeed c
and c
they c
can c
also c
have c
the c
chance c
to c
talk c
with i
them c
and c
know c
these c
famous c
persons c
' c
thought i
by c
using c
the c
social c
media c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
with c
the c
help c
of c
social c
media c
, c
some c
homeless c
people c
or c
someone c
who c
need i
the i
money c
to c
cure c
the i
disease c
can c
get c
the i
help c
from c
the c
world c
quickly c
because c
once c
one i
person c
know i
the i
information c
, c
his i
or c
her c
will i
share c
it c
to c
their c
" c
friends c
area c
" c
, c
then c
many c
people c
will i
know i
it c
and c
spread c
the c
information c
to c
the i
person c
who c
can c
give c
help c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
there c
are c
also c
problems c
with c
the c
population i
of c
the i
social c
media c
. c

Firstly c
, c
when c
people c
rely c
on c
the i
social c
media c
to c
communicate c
with c
their c
friends c
and c
parents c
, c
they c
will i
accustom i
to c
communicate i
by c
typing c
and c
not c
talking c
. c

People c
even c
prefer c
talk i
to c
their c
friends c
and c
meet c
their c
friends c
online c
and c
gradually c
reject c
face-to-face c
communication c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the i
social c
media c
truly c
limit c
the i
interpersonal c
skills c
such i
that c
people c
lose c
the c
chance c
and c
the c
ability c
to c
practice c
talking c
and c
connect i
the i
relation c
between c
him c
and c
their c
friends c
. c

Secondly c
, c
without c
the i
truly i
communication c
in i
the c
real c
life c
, c
people c
lose c
the c
ability c
to c
see c
the c
truth c
and i
false c
. c

There c
are c
many c
people c
in c
the i
social c
media c
with c
beautiful c
image i
and c
good c
content c
in c
their c
pages c
, c
however c
in c
real c
life c
, c
he i
or c
she c
may c
do i
not c
have c
jobs c
or c
live i
poorly c
. c

Teenagers c
may c
believe c
these c
people c
and c
easily i
be c
cheat i
and c
lose c
money c
even i
their c
safe c
. c

Therefore c
, c
the c
social c
media c
is c
not c
safe c
which c
is c
bad c
to i
teenager i
's c
future c
development c
. c

All c
in c
all c
, c
the c
appearance c
of c
social c
media c
truly c
helps c
people c
a c
lot c
in c
many c
areas c
. c

However c
, c
there c
exits c
some c
disadvantages c
which c
will i
affect c
people c
in i
some c
degree c
. c

Advantages c
and c
Disadvantages c
of c
Using c
Social c
Media c
in c
Our c
Daily c
life i
and c
Society c
. c

Nowadays c
, c
with c
the c
development c
of c
technology c
and c
society c
, c
social c
media c
become i
more c
popular c
and i
even c
important c
in i
our c
daily c
life i
. c

We c
communicate c
with c
others c
using c
social c
media c
, c
such c
as c
twitter c
, c
facebook c
and c
microblog c
more c
and c
more c
frequently c
. c

There c
is c
no c
need c
to i
for c
people c
to c
go c
out c
of c
their c
home c
to c
interact c
with c
others c
, i
they c
chat c
online c
, c
share c
pictures c
, c
tell c
others c
what c
they c
have c
done c
or c
funny i
stories c
. c

It c
seems c
that c
people c
build c
a i
good c
relationship i
with c
others c
by i
the i
social c
media c
, c
but c
the c
problems c
come i
out c
. c

Pepope i
do c
not c
know c
how c
to c
talk c
with c
others c
face c
to c
face c
, c
especially c
the i
strangers c
. c

Then i
, c
we i
need c
to c
talk i
about c
the c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c
using c
social c
media c
in c
your i
daily c
life c
and c
society c
. c

As c
for c
the c
advantages c
, c
there c
are c
two c
aspects c
: i
more i
convenient c
to c
contact c
others c
, i
easier c
to c
know i
about c
others c
. c

One c
advantage c
is c
that c
it c
is c
more c
convenience i
to c
contact c
others c
by c
social c
media c
. c

In c
old i
days c
, c
if c
one c
wants i
to c
tell i
some c
important c
news c
to c
another i
one c
, c
which i
lives i
far c
away c
, c
he i
needs c
to c
write c
letters c
and c
it c
wastes i
time c
. c

The c
long c
distance c
and c
time-consuming c
make i
spreading c
the i
messages c
very c
difficult c
at c
that c
time c
. c

Therefore c
, c
people c
may c
not c
contact i
with c
the i
faraway c
friends c
and c
relatives c
unless c
there c
are i
something c
important c
. i

However c
, c
people c
now c
can c
contact c
with i
anyone c
all i
over c
the c
world c
who c
can c
use c
computer i
at c
any c
time c
, c
and c
there c
is c
no c
time c
delay c
of i
messages c
. c

The c
other c
advantage c
is c
that c
it c
is c
easier c
to c
know i
about c
others c
by c
social c
media c
. c

If c
there c
is i
no c
social c
media c
, c
it c
is i
difficult c
for c
people c
to c
know i
about c
a c
stranger c
. c

They c
may i
collect c
information c
about c
that c
person c
by c
asking c
his c
friends c
, c
colleagues c
or c
family c
members c
. c

And c
the c
information c
collected c
may c
not c
be c
intact c
and c
true c
. c

Unlike i
today c
, c
with c
the c
help c
with i
social c
media c
, c
people c
can c
easily c
get c
the c
information c
they c
want i
just c
by c
searching c
on c
line c
, c
and i
know c
about c
what c
that c
person c
did c
everyday c
at c
what i
time c
. c

As c
for c
the c
disadvantages c
of c
social c
media c
in c
our c
daily c
life c
, c
wasting i
time c
, c
causing c
illness c
related c
to c
sitting c
long i
time c
before i
the c
computer c
, c
quick-spread i
of c
rumor c
and c
fake c
news c
, c
most i
importantly c
, c
making i
people c
lost c
the c
ability c
to c
talk c
to c
others c
face c
to c
face c
confidently c
. c

It c
is c
weird c
that c
people c
sit c
around c
the i
table c
but c
all c
face c
to i
their c
phones c
and c
do c
not c
talk c
with c
each c
other c
. c

If c
there c
is c
a c
joke c
on c
their c
facebook c
page c
, c
they c
may c
talk c
to c
others c
in c
this c
way c
, c
" c
hi c
, c
look c
, c
how c
ridiculous c
this c
is c
" c
, c
then c
they c
laugh c
together c
. c

No c
matter c
it i
is c
a c
party c
, c
dinner c
or c
just c
simply c
get-together i
, c
there c
always i
are c
some c
people c
bow i
their c
head c
and c
playing i
their c
phones c
even c
their i
family c
and c
friends c
are c
in c
front c
of c
them c
. c

In c
a i
conclusion c
, c
there c
are c
both c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of i
using c
social c
media c
in c
daily c
life c
. c

People c
should c
enjoy c
the c
advantages c
of c
social c
media c
while c
be c
aware c
of c
the c
disadvantages c
of i
that c
and c
try c
their c
best c
to c
avoid c
the c
disadvantages c
happen i
to c
them c
and c
their c
friends c
and c
family c
. c

Today c

The c
advantages c
and c
disadvantages c
of c

Young c

widen c
their c
relationships c
, c
meet c
new c
friends c
and c
learn c
wonderful c
things c
in i
many c
parts c
of c
the c
world c
. c

In c
business i
area c
, c
social c
media c
is c
a c
good c
tool c
to c
develop c
and c
advertise c
products c
and c
services c
. c

On c
the c
other c
hand c
, c
social c
media c
also c
has c
disadvantages c
which c
have c
created c
worries c
to i
the i
society c
recently c
and c
made c
it c
a c
controversial c
phenomenon c
. c

More c
and c
more c
young c
people c
tend c
to c
live c
in c
social i
media c
world c
most c
of c
their c
time c
and c
reduce c
face-to-face c
human c
contact c
, c
which c
can c
affect c
interpersonal c
skills c
and c
relationships c
in c
social i
life c
. c

First c
and c
foremost c
, c
we c
should c
realize c
that c
social i
media c
world c
is c
not c
trustworthy c
and c
real c
. c

Everyone i
can c
easily c
make c
up c
the i
personality c
and c
characteristics i
they c
want c
. i

They c
can c
become c
anyone c
. c

Though c
social c
media c
do i
create c
relationships c
, c
relationships c
and c
friendships c
are c
only c
firm c
and c
real c
if c
people c
have c
gone c
through c
experiences c
and c
communication c
in c
face-to-face c
interaction c
. c

There c
is c
a c
story c
of c
a c
girl c
who c
lives i
in c
social i
media c
world c
every c
night c
in i
eight c
years c
. c

In c
the c
chat c
room c
, c
she c
created c
a c
close c
relationship c
with c
eight c
people c
. c

She c
talked c
with i
them c
every c
night c
, c
trust i
them c
and c
share i
her c
life c
with c
them c
. c

Then c
eventually c
, c
she c
discovered c
that c
eight i
people c
became i
one c
as c
he i
was c
using c
eight c
different c
identities c
to c
chat c
with c
her c
all c
the c
time c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
the c
convenience c
of c
social c
media c
is c
also c
its c
weakness c
. c

A c
lot c
of c
people c
use c
their c
true c
information c
on c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
which c
can c
lead c
to c
crimes c
and c
deception c
. c

People c
can c
use c
the c
information c
to c
deceive c
family c
and c
friends c
and c
banks c
to c
do c
bad c
things c
such c
as c
blackmail c
, c
ATM c
theft c
and c
so c
on c
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
, c
social c
media c
does i
affect c
human c
interpersonal c
skills c
when c
people c
increase c
the c
time c
on i
social c
sites c
and c
reject c
chances c
to c
expose i
to c
social c
daily c
life c
activities c
as c
well c
as c
interacting c
with c
people c
. c

Recent c
research c
has c
shown c
that c
the c
more c
people c
spend c
time c
on c
social c
media c
sites c
, c
the c
less c
they c
become c
ambitious c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
if c
the c
situation c
keep i
go c
on c
in c
this c
unexpected c
trend i
, c
it c
will c
cause i
a c
bad c
effect c
on c
the c
young c
generation c
. c

To c
put c
it c
in c
the i
nutshell c
, c
everything c
has c
its i
own c
pros c
and c
cons c
. c

So i
does c
social c
media c
network i
. c

It i
not c
only c
is c
convenient c
and c
beneficial c
in c
connecting c
people c
and c
developing c
the i
business c
but c
it i
also c
can i
damage i
people i
relationships c
and c
interpersonal c
skills c
. c

Social c
media c
is c
only c
beneficial c
as c
long c
as c
we c
know c
how c
to c
use c
it c
in c
a c
correct c
and c
suitable c
way c
with i
the i
combination i
of i
both c
social c
media c
sites c
and c
daily c
life c
interaction c
to c
develop c
people c
's c
potentials c
to c
the c
fullest c
. c
