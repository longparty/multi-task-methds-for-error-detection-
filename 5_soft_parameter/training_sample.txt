Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
in c
order c
to c
express c
my c
disappointment c
about i
your c
musical c
show c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
. c

I c
saws i
the c
show c
's c
advertisement c
hanging c
up c
of i
a c
wall c
in c
London c
where c
I c
was c
spending c
my c
holiday c
with c
some c
friends c
. c
I c
convinced c
them c
to c
go c
there c
with c
me c
because c
I c
had c
heard c
good c
references i
about i
your c
Company c
and c
, c
above c
all c
, c
about i
the c
main c
star c
, c
Danny c
Brook c
. c

The c
problems c
started c
in i
the c
box c
office c
, c
where c
we c
asked c
for c
the c
discounts c
you c
announced c
in c
the c
advertisement c
, c
and c
the c
man c
who c
was c
selling c
the c
tickets c
said c
that c
they c
did c
n't c
exist c
. c

Moreover c
, c
the c
show c
was c
delayed c
forty c
- c
five c
minutes c
and c
the c
worst c
of c
all c
was c
that c
Danny c
Brook c
had c
been c
replaced c
by c
another c
actor c
. c

On i
the c
other c
hand c
, c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
because i
unknown c
reasons c
. c

You c
promised c
a c
perfect c
evening c
but c
it c
became c
a c
big c
disastrous i
! c

I c
would c
like c
some c
kind c
of c
explanation c
and c
receive i
my c
money c
back c
. c

If c
you c
do c
n't c
agree c
, c
I c
will c
act c
consequently i
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Last c
Wednesday c
Carole c
received c
a c
letter c
. c

The c
stamp c
was c
from c
a c
foreign c
country c
and c
the c
address c
was c
written c
in c
Capital c
Letters c
. c

She c
did c
n't c
recognize c
the c
writing c
. c

She c
began c
to c
read c
" i
Dear c
Carolin c
.. c

There c
was c
only c
a i
person c
who c
used c
to c
call c
her c
by c
this c
name c
. c

It c
brought c
a c
lot c
of c
memories c
back c
to c
her c
. c

It c
was c
long c
time c
ago c
, c
when c
she c
was c
fourteen c
and c
Paul c
sixteen c
. c

He c
was c
her c
first c
love c
and c
also c
the c
first c
who c
kissed c
her c
. c

Paul c
had c
to c
move c
to c
Mexico c
because c
of c
his c
father c
's c
work c
. c

When c
they c
were c
saying c
goodbye c
Paul c
" i
I c
will c
be c
the c
last c
person c
who c
will c
kiss c
you c
" c
. c
" c
It c
sounds c
nice c
but c
I c
do c
n't c
believe c
it c
" i
she c
replied c
. c

" c
You c
only c
have c
to c
wait c
" i
he c
said c
. c

But c
she c
did c
n't c
wait c
. c

She c
got c
married c
and c
had c
two c
children c
. c

At c
this i
moment c
Carole c
was c
living c
with c
her c
husband c
but c
they c
did c
n't c
love c
each c
other c
any c
more c
. c

Their c
love c
had c
finished c
. c

In c
his c
letter c
Paul c
said c
that c
he c
had c
become c
a c
rich c
man c
and c
he c
would c
come c
back c
to c
meet c
her c
again c
. c

Her c
friend c
Pat c
had c
explained c
the c
whole c
story c
at i
her c
husband c
. c

What c
she i
would c
do c
? c

10 c
June c
2000 c

Dear c
Manager c
, c

I c
would c
like c
to c
complain c
about c
your c
theatre c
and c
the c
musical c
show c
that c
I c
saw c
last c
week c
. c

I c
went c
to c
London c
for c
a c
holiday c
last c
week c
and c
read c
the c
advertisement c
about c
' c
Over c
the c
rainbow c
' c
in c
the c
hotel c
which c
I c
stayed c
. i

I c
saw c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
were c
written c
on c
the c
advertisement c
paper c
and c
was c
very c
excited c
. c

However c
, c
Danny c
Brook c
did c
not c
appear c
on c
the c
stage c
until c
the c
end c
of c
musical c
showing c
time c
. c

I c
was c
really c
disappointed c
about c
it c
. c

Secondly c
, c
starting i
time c
was c
19:30 c
but c
it c
started c
20:15 c
so c
I c
was c
waited i
for c
45 c
minutes c
. c

It c
was c
so i
long c
time c
to c
wait c
in c
the c
theatre c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
it c
mentioned c
about c
discounts c
. c

Despite c
of i
the c
fact c
that c
I c
am c
a c
student c
, c
I c
could c
not c
get c
any c
discounts c
. c

I c
also c
visited c
your c
restaurant c
after c
the c
show c
but c
already i
closed c
because c
the c
show c
finished c
late c
. c

Because i
of c
the c
reason i
above c
, c
I c
, c
indeed c
, c
spent c
awful i
last c
night c
in c
London c
. c

I c
would c
like c
you c
to c
refund c
, c
otherwise c
, c
I c
will c
take c
an i
action c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
receiving c
reply i
to c
my c
enquiry c
. c

Sincerely c

Fashion c
of c
the c
future c

People c
will c
wear c
this c
kind c
of c
clothes c
100 c
years c
later i
from c
now c
. c

If c
weather i
is c
hot c
then c
we c
do c
n't c
have c
to c
wear c
under i
wear c
because c
very c
thin c
and c
light c
clothes c
will c
support c
our c
bodies c
. c

There c
will c
be c
two c
functions c
for c
summer c
clothes c
that c
we c
do c
n't c
need c
to c
wear c
clothes c
like i
layer c
and c
layer c
. c

For c
example c
, c
T c
- c
shirts c
for c
women c
are i
included c
bra i
: c
easy c
to c
take c
it c
out c
when c
you c
wash c
it c
, c
is i
very c
simple c
and c
comfortable c
. c

What c
about c
short c
pants c
? c

You c
do c
n't c
have c
to c
wear c
knickers c
. c

We c
can c
just c
put c
some c
thin c
pads c
in c
there c
. c

We c
ca c
n't c
feel c
it c
and c
easy c
to c
remove c
and c
just c
can i
wash c
it c
. c

Simplest c
is c
the c
best c
in c
summer c
! c

When c
it c
's c
very c
cold c
winter i
, c
we c
just c
wear c
light c
clothes c
what i
we c
want c
, c
in c
our c
style c
. c

Because c
special c
warm c
and c
healthy c
material c
will c
be c
developed c
and c
use i
them i
inside c
thin c
clothes c
so c
we c
do c
n't c
need c
to c
put c
heavy c
clothes c
on c
our c
bodies c
. c

We c
can c
show c
our c
body i
line c
in c
winter c
as c
well c
. c

Most c
important c
thing c
is c
that c
we c
do c
n't c
have c
to c
kill c
the i
animals c
only i
for c
people c
's c
cruel c
aims c
. c

Functions i
' c
clothes c
are c
the c
way c
to c
love c
animals c
! c

ROBERTSON c

DEAR c
SIR c
, c

I c
WANT c
TO c
THAK i
YOU c
FOR c
PREPARING c

A c

FOR c
TAKING c

THE c
RIVER c

I c
WOULD c
LIKE c
TO c

IF c
THERE c
IS c
ANY c
CHANCE c
OF c
CHANGING c

VERY c
INTERESTING c

CONSISTS i
ON c

THE c
LONDON c
FASHION c
AND c
LEISURE c
SHOW c
IN i
THE c
CENTRAL c
EXHIBITION c

I c
THINK c
IT c
'S c
A c
GREAT c
OPPORTUNITY c
TO c
MAKE c
GREATER c
USE c
OF c
OUR c
KNOWLEDGE c
OF c
ENGLISH i
LANGUAGE c

ON i
THE c
OTHER c

THE c
DIFFERENT c
WAYS c
TO c
GET c
TO c
THE c
CENTRAL c
EXHIBITION c
HALL c
. c

I c
SUGGEST c
THAT c
WE c
SHOULD c
GO c
TO c
THE c
NATIONAL c
ART c
GALLERY c
IN c
THE c
MORNING c
AND c
INSTEAD c
OF c
HAVING c

AS c
SOME c
OF c
THEM c
ARE c
CONSIDERED c
IDOLS c
, c
THEIR c
FANS c
WANT c
TO c
KNOW c
HOW c

ACT i
IN c
THEIR c
PRIVATE c
LIVES c

WITH c
THEIR c
FAMILY c

BECAUSE c
THEY c

NOT c

THE c
MOST c
IMPORTANT c
THING c
IS c
THAT c

PAY c
A c
PRICE c
FOR c
BEING c

IN i
SOME c

MORE c

To c
Mr. c
Robertson c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
tell c
you c
something c
about c
the c
three c
- c
day c
trip c
to c
London c
. c

I c
have c
seen c
your c
programme c
for c
the c
trip c
and c
I c
think c
it c
is c
going c
to c
be c
a c
great c
trip c
. c

Thank c
you c
very c
much c
for c
organising c
this c
trip c
and c
putting c
all c
your c
spare c
time c
and c
effort c
into c
it c
. c

Personally c
, c
I c
enjoy c
looking c
and i
learning c
about c
new c
inventions c
and c
all c
the c
science c
. c

That c
is c
why c
I c
think c
the c
trip c
to c
the c
science c
museum c
is c
a c
good c
idea c
. c

However c
, c
my c
class c
and c
I c
have c
seen c
an c
advertisement c
about i
a c
fashion c
and c
leisure c
show c
. c
We c
are c
attracted c
to c
this c
show c
and c
would c
like c
to c
go c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
it c
is c
on c
14th c
March c
, c
which c
is c
the c
day c
we c
will c
be c
visiting c
the c
science c
museum c
. c

This c
show c
is c
on c
the c
14th c
March c
. c

It c
is c
in c
the c
Central c
Exhibition c
Hall c
and c
will c
start c
and i
ten c
o'clock c
and c
finish c
at c
five c
o'clock c
in c
the c
evening c
. c

Apparently c
, c
this c
show c
is c
free c
to c
all c
students c
, c
which c
means c
if c
we c
went c
, c
the c
cost c
of c
the c
trip c
will i
be c
cut i
down c
. c

I c
think c
it c
is c
a c
great c
opportunity c
because c
it c
is c
based c
on c
fashion c
. c

We c
like c
to c
keep c
up c
with c
the c
rage i
but c
I c
think c
it c
will c
help c
those c
who c
want c
to c
become c
a i
fashion c
designer i
later c
on c
. c

I c
have c
a c
suggestion c
on c
how c
the c
programme c
could c
be c
changed c
. c

The c
shopping c
time c
could c
be c
after c
the c
show c
and c
the c
free c
time c
exchanged c
for c
the c
science c
museum c
. c

If c
we c
go c
to c
the c
show c
, c
we c
can c
do c
without c
the c
free c
time c
. c

Please c
give c
this c
your c
careful c
consideration c
.. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

In c
a c
country c
like c
the c
UK c
, c
we c
are c
all c
bound c
to c
have c
houses c
. c

We c
either c
own c
it c
, c
or c
we c
simply c
borrow c
it c
from c
other c
people c
. c
We c
take c
our c
homes c
for c
granted c
. c

Think c
about c
the c
people c
in c
the c
poor c
countries c
! c

They c
struggle c
to c
survive c
. c

However c
, c
as c
we c
approach c
the c
future c
, c
our c
homes c
will c
start c
to c
change c
. c

Have c
you c
ever c
thought c
about c
how c
the c
changes c
will c
affect c
our c
lives c
? c

I c
doubt c
it c
. c

There c
will c
be c
lots c
of c
differences c
in c
our c
homes c
of c
the c
future c
from c
our c
homes c
now c
, c
but c
there c
may c
also c
be c
a c
lot c
of c
similarities c
. c

For c
one c
, c
the c
future c
homes i
might c
not c
be c
built c
out c
of c
bricks c
at c
all c
! c

It c
may c
be c
built c
out c
of c
a c
stronger c
substance c
or c
a c
more c
attractive c
one c
, c
such c
as c
glass c
. c

Non c
- c
breakable c
glass c
. c

Also c
, c
due c
to c
global c
warming c
, c
sea c
levels c
might c
rise c
and c
risk i
of c
flooding c
will c
also c
rise c
. c

Therefore c
, c
houses c
will c
be c
built c
on c
high c
supports c
. c

All c
domestic c
appliances c
such c
as c
showers c
, c
kettles c
, c
lights c
, c
TV c
and c
curtains c
may c
be c
voice c
activated c
. c

Incredibly c
high c
security c
will c
prevent c
robbery c
. c

The c
future c
homes c
will c
also c
have c
many c
similarities c
, c
such c
as c
having c
a c
separate c
bathroom c
, c
and c
not c
having c
one c
in c
a c
bedroom c
, c
or c
having c
two c
floors c
or c
having c
garages c
. c

It c
has c
been c
a c
pleasure c
sharing c
my c
thoughts c
with c
you c
. c

What c
do c
you c
think c
will c
happen c
in c
the c
future c
? c

Dear c
Mrs. c
Jane i
Clark c
, c

Recently c
I c
was c
at c
the c
annual c
international c
arts c
festival c
, i
that c
you c
organized c
. c

I c
'm c
writing c
this c
letter c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
giving c
a i
possibility i
to c
know c
more c
about c
modern c
art c
. c

I c
think c
, i
it c
is c
a c
wonderful c
idea c
to c
organize c
such c
festivals c
each c
year c
, c
because c
it c
is c
very c
interesting c
to c
learn c
some c
news c
about c
life c
in c
other c
countries c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
only c
six c
countries c
were c
represented c
this c
year c
at c
the c
festival c
, c
but c
I c
hope c
that c
soon c
there c
would i
be c
much i
more c
of c
them c
. c

I c
extremely i
liked c
all c
concerts i
, c
shows c
, c
exhibitions i
, c
but c
why c
there i
were c
n't c
any c
photograph i
exhibitions c
? c

I c
think c
, i
you c
should c
make i
some c
next c
year c
. c

Then i
, c
I c
want c
to c
mark i
, i
that c
concert i
halls c
were c
too c
small c
, c
that c
is c
why c
they c
were c
overcrowded c
during c
some c
concerts c
. c

Then i
, c
I c
want c
to c
say c
, i
that c
plays i
and c
films c
were c
exellent i
, c
but c
it i
was i
n't c
enough c
of c
them c
for c
me c
. c

May i
be c
you c
should c
make i
more c
next c
year c
? i

And c
at i
the c
end c
, c
my c
opinion c
is c
that c
one c
weekend c
ticket c
for c
all c
events c
is c
a c
great c
idea c
, c
because c
you c
do c
n't c
have c
to c
stay i
in c
queues c
to c
buy c
a c
ticket c
for c
a c
show c
, i
you c
want c
to c
go c
to c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Dear c
Lucia c
, c

I c
was c
very c
pleased c
to c
receive c
your c
letter c
. c

You c
asked c
, i
if c
there c
are c
some c
school c
rules c
in c
my c
country c
. c

As c
you c
know c
, c
I c
'm c
studying c
at c
the i
private c
Academy c
, c
so c
the c
rules c
in c
my c
institute c
are c
different c
from c
the c
rules c
in c
state c
institutes c
. c
I c
'll c
give c
you c
an c
example c
. c

In c
our c
Acadamy i
we c
are c
not c
allowed c
to c
smoke c
. c

The c
fine c
for c
smoking c
on c
the c
Academy c
is i
territory i
is c
100 c
dollars c
. c

So c
nobody c
smokes c
there c
. c

I c
do c
n't c
smoke c
, c
so c
I c
do c
n't c
care c
about c
this c
rule c
. c

But c
some c
of c
my c
friends c
really c
would c
like c
to c
change c
it c
. c

You c
also c
wanted c
to c
know c
about c
what c
I c
'm c
allowed c
or c
not c
allowed c
to c
do c
at c
home c
. c

Well c
, c
I c
have c
rather c
modern c
parents c
, c
so c
they c
do c
n't c
prohibit i
me c
to i
go c
to c
the i
discoes i
or c
somewhere c
with c
my c
friends c
. c

The c
only c
rule c
for c
me c
at c
home c
is c
to c
walk c
out i
with i
my c
dog c
three c
times c
a c
day c
. c

I c
hope c
it c
was c
interesting c
for c
you c
to c
know c
about c
the c
rules c
in c
my c
life c
. c

Look i
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
, c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
was i
to c
Circle i
Theatre c
to c
watch c
' i
Over c
the c
rainbow c
' c
musical c
show c
, c
recently c
. c

I c
was c
trully i
dissapointed i
by c
it c
. c

My c
expectations c
were c
high c
after c
I c
've i
read c
your c
leaflet c
in c
which c
it c
was c
advertised c
as c
' c
London c
's c
newest c
and c
best c
musical c
show c
' c
. c

Now c
, c
I c
can c
assure c
you c
it c
was c
n't c
. c

Firstly c
, c
it c
was c
Danny c
Brook c
who c
was c
supposed c
to c
star c
. c

The c
substitute c
was c
far c
worse c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
had c
to c
wait c
fourty i
- c
five c
minutes c
before c
the c
show c
finally c
began c
. c

Another c
unkept c
promise c
are i
the c
discounts c
. c

There c
were c
n't c
any c
! c

Lastly c
, c
when c
I c
got c
hungry c
after c
the c
delay c
it c
appeared c
that c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
is i
closed c
. c
You c
can c
believe c
me c
it c
was c
n't c
' c
my c
perfect c
evening c
out c
' c
and c
I c
have c
no c
other c
choice c
than c
asking i
to i
give c
my i
money c
back c
. c

I c
paid c
for c
something c
I c
did c
n't c
get c
so c
it c
is c
obvious c
that c
I c
want c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
got c
the c
£ c
15 c
ticket c
. c

I c
'd c
like c
you c
to c
send c
the c
money c
to c
this c
adress i
; i

Yours c
sincerely i
, c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

After c
two c
days c
the i
whole c
school c
knew c
. c

When c
Paul c
entered c
the c
school c
gate c
, c
other c
children c
began c
to c
tease c
him c
and c
laugh c
. c

Paul c
could c
n't c
stand c
it c
. c

He c
ran c
out c
quickly c
, c
leaving c
everyone c
behind c
. c

He c
felt c
very c
ashamed c
and c
did c
n't c
know c
what c
to c
do c
. c

Normally c
, c
he c
would c
go c
and c
talk c
to c
Pat c
but c
Pat c
betrayed c
him c
. c

They c
were c
no c
longer c
friends c
. c
' c

How c
could c
he c
, c
' c
Paul c
thought c
' c
Now c
the c
whole c
school c
knows c
Jean c
attracts c
me c
' c
. c

As c
he c
was c
sitting c
there c
, c
he c
heard c
someone c
walking c
towards c
him c
. c

He c
turned c
around c
and c
saw c
... c
Jean c
. c
' c

What c
are c
you c
dong i
here c
, i
why c
are c
n't c
you c
at c
school c
? c
' c

she c
asked c
. c

Paul c
was c
like i
paralyzed c
. c

He c
could c
n't c
reply c
. c
' c

I c
had i
heard c
what c
you c
've c
said c
about c
me c
' c
, c
she c
said c
, c
I c
think c
it c
's c
sweet c
' c
. c

Paul c
could c
n't c
believe c
his c
ears c
. c

While c
he c
was c
thinking c
how c
to c
reply c
, c
Jean c
took c
his c
hand c
and c
led c
him c
to c
the c
school c
. c

When c
they c
entered c
everyone c
became c
silent c
. c

All c
the c
children c
were c
staring c
at c
them c
and c
Paul c
thought c
that c
Pat c
is i
n't c
that c
bad c
at c
all c
. c

. c

About c

while c
at c
the c
Camp c
I i
would c
like c
to c
enjoy i
swimming c
, c
not c
because c
I c
am c
good c
in i
it c
, c
just c
because c
I c
keen i
on c
and i
the c
other c
one c
is c
Photography c
. c

As c
I c
never c
did c
this c
in c
whole i
my c
life c
could c
you c
tell c
me c
if c

to c

our c
own c
meals c
or c

? c

If c

Dear c
friend c

Kim c

Last c
month c
, c
I c
enjoyed c
to i
help c
at c
a c
pop c
concert c
in c
Portugal c
. c

Everything c
were i
new c
for c
me c
. c

I c
had c
to c
( i
lyd c
) c
tidy c
up c
the c
place c
where c
they c
have c
to c
wait c
until i
their c
turn c
. c

The c
group c
asked c
me c
make i
sure c
that c
in c
the c
fridge c
they c
always c
could c
find c
a c
big i
variety c
of c
drinks c
including c
honey c
and c
lemon c
for c
throat i
. c

Other i
thing c
I c
had c
to c
do c
is i
keep c
an c
eye c
in i
the c
towels c
, c
I c
mean c
, c
dried i
towels c
because c
as c
you c
know c
that c
country c
is c
too c
hot c
, c
especially c
for c
my c
liking c
, c
as i
they c
have c
to c
change c
the i
clothes c
and c
looks i
fresh c
; c
do c
n't c
ask c
me c
why c
. c

The c
pop c
concert c
happened i
in c
a c
big c
stadium c
called c
" c
Mararcanã c
" c
. c

I c
just c
did c
not c
enjoyed i
when i
they c
were c
making i
the c
instruments c
work c
for c
the c
big c
day c
. c

But c
what c
I c
particularly c
liked c
was c
see i
and c
ask c
autographs c
from c
the c
rest c
of c
the c
others c
groups c
. c

Do c
n't c
be c
jealous c
, c
I c
will c
make c
a c
copy c
for c
you c
, c
OK c
? c

Love c

Dear c
Ms c
Jane c
Clark c
. c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
you c
with c
regard c
to c
the c
International c
Art c
Festival c
that c
was c
held c
recently c
. c

The c
festival c
was c
excenent i
in c
many c
ways c
, c
and c
especially i
it c
being c
an c
international c
festival c
was c
a c
challenging c
, c
but c
brilliant c
idea c
. c

I c
assume c
that c
this c
fact c
attracted c
people c
very c
much c
. c

In c
addition c
to c
that c
, c
organising c
one c
weekend c
with c
special c
price c
tickets c
was c
particularly c
good c
. c

I c
personally c
think c
that c
it c
helped c
many c
people c
who c
were c
not c
able c
to c
afford c
the c
tickets c
with i
proper i
price c
to c
come c
to c
the c
festival c
. c

Moreover c
, c
most c
of c
the c
events c
I c
went c
to c
were c
fantastic c
. c

However c
, c
I c
still c
have c
some c
comments c
to c
make c
to c
improve c
the c
festival c
next c
year c
. c

The c
festival c
was c
supposed c
to c
be c
an c
international c
one c
, c
but c
the c
artists c
and c
stars c
participated i
in c
it c
were c
from c
six c
countries c
only c
. c

Thus c
, c
I c
recommend c
that c
stars c
and c
artists c
of c
various c
nationalities c
should c
be c
invited c
. c

Also c
, c
some c
of c
the c
concert c
halls c
where c
the c
musicians c
performed c
were c
not c
big c
enough c
for c
the c
vast c
number c
of c
audiences i
. c

I c
think c
it c
would c
be c
much c
better c
to c
use c
bigger c
concert c
halls c
. c

Furthermore c
, c
I c
found c
that c
there c
were c
not c
many c
genres c
of i
neither i
the c
films c
nor c
the c
plays c
. c

So c
I c
suggest c
you c
have c
various c
kinds c
, c
and c
more c
numbers i
of c
plays c
and c
films c
next c
year c
. c

I c
hope c
that c
next c
year c
's c
festival c
will c
be c
much c
more c
successful c
that i
this c
year c
's c
one c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

The c
Old c
Man c
and c
the c
Sea c

People c
all c
have c
different c
opinions c
about c
books c
. c

Some c
prefer c
realistic c
stories c
whereas c
others c
do i
unusual c
ones c
. c

But c
I c
prefer c
realistic c
stories c
such c
as c
Ernest c
Hemingway c
's c
" c
The c
Old c
Man c
and c
the c
Sea c
' c
. c

Above c
all c
, c
realistic c
stories c
teach c
me c
something c
of i
the i
life c
, c
or c
at c
least c
influence c
me c
. c

As c
far c
as c
I c
'm c
concerned c
, c
my c
behaviour c
and c
attitudes c
towards c
a c
difficult c
situation c
began c
to c
change c
after c
reading c
this c
book c
. c

Here c
, c
the c
fishman c
is c
very c
old c
, c
but c
he c
is c
still c
challenging c
to i
everything c
he c
faces c
. c

When c
he c
caught c
a c
shark c
which c
was c
bigger c
than c
the c
ship c
, c
he c
never c
gave c
up c
taking i
it c
back c
to c
his c
village c
, c
even c
when c
sharks c
were c
around c
him c
. c

Real c
stories c
have c
huge c
impacts c
on c
me c
, c
and c
affect c
me c
a c
lot c
, c
often c
in c
good c
ways c
. c

In c
addition c
to c
that c
, c
realistic c
stories c
are c
more c
attractive c
, c
I c
personally c
do c
n't c
want c
to c
hear c
stories c
about c
very c
peculiar c
incidents c
as c
I c
know c
they c
can c
not c
be c
true c
. c

But c
, c
while c
reading c
realistic c
stories c
, c
I c
just c
fall c
deep c
into c
the c
story c
, c
into c
the c
writer c
's c
own c
world c
. c

Ernest c
Hemingway c
's c
sentences c
are c
precise c
, c
but c
still c
very c
powerful c
and c
alive c
. c

So c
when c
I c
read c
other i
sharks c
eating c
the c
shark c
the c
old c
man c
had c
caught c
, c
I c
got c
very c
angry c
and c
annoyed c
. c

Realistic c
stories c
thus c
, c
develop c
our c
imagination c
and c
creativity c
, c
which c
are c
essential c
in c
our c
lives c
. c

We c
all c
learn c
from c
reading c
books c
, c
but c
realistic c
stories c
have c
more c
influence c
on c
me c
and c
develop c
my c
personality c
. c

That c
's c
why c
I c
prefer c
realistic c
stories c
to c
unusual c
ones c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
, c

I c
would c
like c
to c
complain c
about c
a c
musical c
show c
. c

I c
was c
very c
disappointing i
a i
week c
holiday i
for i
me c
because c
I c
had c
got i
a c
lot c
of c
problem i
with c
the c
show c
. c

I c
had c
seen c
the i
advertisement c
that c
the c
actors c
were c
Danny c
Brook c
and c
Tina c
Truelove c
, c
but c
it c
was c
not c
Danny c
Brook c
. c

I c
was c
really c
disappointing i
because c
he c
is c
my c
famous i
actor c
. c

The c
musical c
should c
started i
at c
19.30 c
, c
but c
it c
started c
at c
20.15 c
. c

When c
I c
went c
to c
asked i
for c
the c
discount c
of i
ticket i
in i
the c
cashier c
desk c
they c
told c
me c
no c
discount c
available i
for i
this c
. c

I c
had c
seen c
the c
advertisement c
say i
that c
discount i
available i
. c

After c
the c
show c
I c
decide i
to c
had i
dinner c
in c
your c
theatre c
restaurant c
, c
but c
I c
could c
n't c
because c
it c
closed i
. c

It c
closed c
at c
10 c
pm c
but c
the c
show c
finished c
at c
10.30 c
pm c
. c

This c
was c
not c
perfect i
evening c
for c
me c
, c
so c
if c
you c
do c
n't c
give c
my i
money c
back c
, c
I c
will c
tell c
to i
the c
newspaper c
about c
it c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hear i
a i
good c
new i
. c

Yours c
sincerely i
, c

Boo c
Sersuwan c
. c

I c
think c
in c
the c
next c
100 c
years c
people c
will c
wear c
the i
space i
clothes c
with c
small i
engine c
in c
the c
back c
. i
because c
of c
the c
atmosphere c
. c

The c
atmosphere c
in i
the c
earth c
now i
starting i
badly c
every c
years i
. c

The c
carbon i
dioxide c
are i
growing c
very c
fast c
and c
people c
cut c
more i
trees c
, c
therefore c
not i
enough c
trees c
to c
such i
carbon c
dioxide c
and c
produce c
oxygen c
. c

The c
designer i
will c
have c
a c
lot c
of c
idea i
for i
how c
to c
make c
very c
nice c
and c
useful c
clothes c
. c

I c
think c
if c
we c
wear c
this i
clothes c
we c
will c
travel c
to i
every i
where c
easier c
than c
we c
use c
cars c
, c
ships c
, c
planes c
and c
space i
ships c
. c

This c
mean i
the c
engineering c
will c
find c
the c
way c
to c
useless c
petrol c
for c
it c
, c
so c
it c
must c
useful c
in c
the c
future c
. c

I c
think c
somebody c
will c
make i
a c
very c
big c
area c
to c
grow c
plant i
because i
they c
can c
sell c
the c
oxygen c
. c

This c
is i
a c
new c
business c
. c

I c
think c
I c
can c
win c
this c
price i
, c
because c
this i
clothe i
will c
produce i
in c
the i
future c
soon c
. c

NAME c
JAMES i
CAMIREZ c
AND c
I'AM i
WRITING c
THIS c
LETTER c
TO c
YOU c
BECAUSE c
I c
HAVE c
SOME c
COMPLEINTS i
FOR i
THE c
DISAPPOINTING c
EVENING c
I c
HAD c
LAST c
NIGHT c
. c

FIRST c
OF c
ALL c
ON i
THE c
ADVERTISEMENT c
FOR c
THE c
SHOW c
IT c
SAYS i
THAT c
THE c
ACTOR c
WAS c
GOING c
TO c
BE c
DANNY c
BROOK c
AND c
INSTEAD c
OF c
HIM c
WAS i
A c
TOTALLY c
UNKNOWN c
CLOWN c
THAT c
HAD c
NO c
IDEA c
OF c
HOW c
TO c
ACT c
, i
IT c
WAS c
HORRIBLY c
DISAPPOINTING c
! c

SECOND c
I c
GOT c
TO c
THE c
THEATRE c
AT c
19.20 c
BECAUSE c
IN c
THE c
ADVERTISEMENT c
IT c
CLEARLY c
APPEARS i
THAT c
THE c
SHOW c
STARTS c
AT c
19.30 c
, c
AND c
I c
GOT c
HEAVILY i
MAD c
WHEN c
I c
LOOK i
MY i
WATCH c
AND c
NOTICE i
THAT c
I c
HAD c
BEEN c
WAITING c
FOR c
40 c
( c
FORTY c
) c
MINUTES c
AND c
THE c
SHOW c
DIDN'T i
START i
YET c
... c
I c
MEAN c
I i
WAS c
AMAIZING i
! c

THEN c
I c
READ c
ON i
THE c
ADVERTISEMENT c
, c
DISCOUNTS i
AVAILABLE c
, i
AND c
I c
DIDN'T c
GOT i
ANY c
DISCOUNTS c
WHEN c
I c
ASKED c
FOR c
THEM c
. c

AFTER c
THE c
SHOW c
I c
GOT c
OUT c
THE i
SHOW i
ROOM c
DEEPLY c
DISAPPOINTED c
AND c
WENT c
TO c
THE c
RESTAURANT c
TO c
DRINK c
SOMETHING c
TO c
RELAX c
, c
AND c
DO c
YOU c
KNOW c
WHAT c
? c

.. c
IT c
WAS c
CLOSED c
! c

I c
COULDN'T c
BELIVE i
IT c
HOW i
THIS i
CLASS c
OF c
THEATRE c
CAN c
BE c
SO c
.. c

OH c
I'M c
GETING c
MAD c
AGAIN c
SO c
I'AM i
GOING c
TO c
TELL c
YOU c
THE i
LAST c
THING c
, c
IT c
WAS c
THE c
HORRIBLE i
NIGHT c
I c
HAD c
EVER c
GOT i
SO c
I c
DEMEND i
FOR i
MY c
MONEY c
BACK c
! c

I c
THINK c
THAT c
MODERN c
TECHNOLOGY c
HAS c
AFFECTED c
ALL c
THE i
HUMAN c
BEINGS c
. c

MODERN c
TECHNOLOGY c
HAS c
AFFECT i
ME c
IN c
SEVERAL c
WAYS c
, i
I c
MEAN c
THE c
MORE c
THE c
TECHNOLOGY c
MODERNIZES i
; c
MORE i
CONFORTNESSCOMFORTABLE i
WE c
GET c
. c

NOW c
WITH c
MODERN c
MACHINES c
I c
CAN c
MAKE c
A i
BETTER c
USE c
OF c
MY c
TIME c
, i
IF c
I'AM i
LATE c
TO c
GO c
TO c
TRAINING c
AND c
I c
HADN'T i
IT i
YET c
I c
JUST c
TAKE c
MY c
FOOD c
AND c
PUT c
IT c
IN c
THE c
MICROWAVEOVEN i
. c

ANOTHER c
EXAMPLE c
IS c
THE i
COMPUTERS c
, i
I c
THINK c
THEY c
ARE c
ONE i
OF c
THE c
MOST c
ADVANCED c
MACHINE i
IN c
THE c
WORLD c
, i
YOU c
CAN c
LIVE c
YOUR c
ENTIRE c
LIFE c
IN c
A c
HOUSE c
WITHOUT c
GOING c
OUT c
, c
BY i
JUST c
USING c
THE c
INTERNET c
, i
IT c
HAS c
ALSO c
HELPED c
ME c
IN i
MY c
SCHOOL i
HOMEWORK c
, i
I c
MEAN c
IT c
'S c
INCREDIBLE c
THE c
TIME c
YOU c
WAIST i
BY c
MAKING i
THING i
WITHOUT c
A c
COMPUTER c
. c

BUT c
I c
THINK c
ALSO c
THAT c
WITH c
MODERN c
TECHNOLOGY c
WE c
GET c
MORE c
COMFORTABLE c
SO c
THAT c
MAKES c
ME c
A c
PACIVE i
PERSON c
AND c
NOT c
SO c
ACTIVE c
, i

THIS c
CAN c
BE c
BAD c
TO i
BECAUSE c
IF c
I c
GET c
USED c
TO c
BE i
CONFORTABLE i
WHEN i
I c
NEED c
TO c
DO c
HARD c
WORKS i
I c
WON'T c
BE c
ABLE c
TO c
DO i
THEM c

Dear c
Ms c
Ryan c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
reply c
your i
letter c
and c
I c
am c
so c
glad i
to c
win i
the c
prize c
. c

Thank c
you c
very c
much c
! c

In c
answer c
your i
questions c
: c
I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
in c
July c
. c

I c
am c
a c
full c
- c
time c
student c
, c
my c
summer c
holidays c
begin c
at c
the c
end c
of c
June c
and c
I c
have c
planned c
to c
work c
on c
my c
grandfather c
's c
farm c
in c
August c
. c

So c
July c
is c
the c
only c
time c
I c
will c
be c
free c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
tents c
to c
log c
cabins c
. c

Camping c
is c
my c
enthusiasm i
and c
I c
sleep c
in c
tents c
every c
time c
I c
go c
camping c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
am c
afraid c
I c
ca c
n't c
get c
used c
to c
log c
cabins c
easily c
. c

Besides c
camping c
, c
I c
also c
like c
painting c
. c

My c
Dad c
is c
an c
amateur c
painter c
, c
and c
I c
have c
begun i
painting c
for c
8 c
years c
. c

I c
'm c
good c
at c
portraits c
and c
landscapes c
. c

I c
would c
also c
like c
to c
play c
golf c
during c
my c
holiday c
, c
but c
I c
have c
never c
played c
it c
before c
, i
will c
I c
get c
any c
tuition c
? c

Finally c
, c
I c
should c
like c
to c
ask c
some c
questions c
. c

How i
is c
the c
weather c
like c
in c
California c
in c
July c
? c

What c
kind c
of c
clothes c
should c
I c
pack c
? c

If c
I c
want c
to c
buy c
some c
gifts c
, c
how c
much c
money c
should c
I c
take c
and c
can c
I c
use c
traveller c
's c
cheques c
in c
every c
place c
? c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

Shopping c
is c
not c
always c
enjoyable c

Our c
lives c
are c
getting c
better c
and c
better c
, c
so c
people c
began i
to c
go c
shopping c
more c
frequently c
. c

It c
's c
always c
a c
great c
job i
to c
go c
home c
with c
bags c
of c
purchases c
, c
but c
is c
it c
doing c
us c
good i
apart c
from c
the c
temporary c
satisfaction c
? c

Everyone c
likes c
sale i
, c
but c
those c
so c
- c
called c
sale c
items c
are c
not c
really c
of i
value c
. c

In c
fashion i
industry c
, c
sale i
begins i
at c
the c
end c
of c
each c
season c
and c
just c
lasts i
a c
short c
time c
, c
because c
those c
owners i
want c
to c
make c
room c
for c
new c
stock c
. c

But c
you c
'll c
find c
your c
' c
cool c
bargain c
' c
soon c
get i
out c
of c
date c
and c
you c
have c
to c
keep c
buying c
new c
ones c
. c

Also c
supermarket c
owners c
have c
put i
in c
a c
vast c
amount c
of c
money c
to c
find c
out c
the c
best c
way c
to c
place c
goods c
in c
order c
to c
get c
the c
most c
profit c
. c

Therefore c
, c
we c
become c
impulsive c
buyers c
easily c
under c
these i
tricks c
. c

The c
result c
, i
we i
feel c
guilty c
after c
spending c
more c
than c
we c
've i
estimated c
, c
or c
even c
suffer c
from c
financial c
difficulty c
. c

Shopping c
does c
not c
just c
effect i
us c
mentally c
, c
but c
also c
physically c
. c

It c
's c
not c
hard c
to c
realise c
how c
exhausted c
we c
are c
after c
a c
day c
of c
shopping c
. c

Think c
of c
the c
awful c
crowds c
, c
the c
busy c
car c
parks c
, c
polluted c
air c
in c
the c
city c
centres c
and c
mile c
- c
long c
queues c
in c
front c
of c
the c
cash c
desks c
. c

I c
do c
n't c
think c
anyone c
would i
really c
like c
to c
face c
them c
. c

But c
once c
you c
get c
there c
, c
they c
're c
just c
inevitable c
, c
are c
n't c
they c
? c

Well c
, c
now c
before c
you c
go c
shopping c
, c
think c
again c
and c
you c
'll c
find i
out c
it c
wo c
n't c
be i
always c
enjoyable c
. c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

Regarding c
the c
programme c
you c
have c
organised c
, c
it i
is c
great c
ideas c
everything c
that c
you c
have c
planed c
, c
but c
I c
would c
like c
to c
suggest c
to i
you c
something c
that c
the c
students c
saw c
in c
an c
advertisement c
. c

It c
is c
good i
start c
to c
go c
on c
sightseeing i
by i
bus c
on c
Monday c
morning c
, c
we i
can c
se i
all c
famous i
buildings c
in c
a c
few c
hours c
. c

It c
's i
seems i
relaxing c
to c
go c
to c
Greenwich c
in c
the c
afternoon c
looking c
though i
the c
river c
. c

The c
idea c
about i
going c
to c
science i
museum c
is c
fantastic c
, i
I c
read c
about c
the c
museum c
, c
it i
is c
really c
interesting c
in i
science i
history c
. c

After c
all c
morning c
in c
the c
Museum i
, c
it c
is c
wonderful c
and c
on c
tuesday i
doing c
some c
shops i
, c
whereas c
the c
student i
have c
another c
idea c
for c
tuesday i
. c

On c
Wednesday c
after c
viseted i
national i
Art c
Gallery c
, c
we c
can c
have c
a c
chat c
about c
ours i
next c
holiday c
at i
the c
free c
time c
in c
the c
afternoon c
. c

The c
advertisement c
that c
students i
saw c
is c
about i
a c
fashion c
show c
, c
but c
to c
go c
to c
the c
show c
you c
will c
need c
cancel i
the c
tour c
on c
tuesday i
and c
add c
the c
show c
, c
because c
the c
show c
is c
from c
10.00 c
to c
19.00 c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully i
, c

Freedom c
! c

Nowadays c
the c
main c
attroction i
in c
the c
newspapers c
and c
television i
is c
private i
life i
of c
famous c
people c
. c

It c
is c
really c
interesting c
how c
people c
like c
knowing i
famous i
people c
life i
. c

Without c
someone c
famous c
know i
, c
photographs i
take c
pictures c
secretly c
, c
try i
to c
get c
money c
on i
it i
. c

Sometimes c
being c
famous c
can c
get c
stress i
, c
everywhere i
they c
go c
there c
are c
people c
around c
them c
, c
especially c
journalists c
, c
trying c
to c
ask c
millions c
questions i
. c

Famous c
people c
deserve c
to c
have c
freedom c
to c
do c
whatever c
they c
want c
, c
but c
it c
is c
quite c
difficult c
to c
do c
thing i
in c
a i
public c
places c
, c
because c
nobody c
like i
famous i
politicians c
or c
film c
stars c
without c
asking c
questions c
. c

On c
the c
whole c
, c
to i
be c
rich c
and c
famous c
do i
n't c
always c
bring c
happeness i
, c
whereas c
the c
majority c
of c
the c
population c
wish c
they c
were c
rich c
and c
famous c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
or c
Madam c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show c
" c
Over c
the c
rainbow c
" c
which i
was c
performed c
in c
your c
theatre c
two c
weeks c
ago c
. c

I c
went c
to c
see c
it c
on c
5th c
June c
2000 c
. c

First c
of c
all c
that i
evening c
there c
was c
not c
Danny c
Brook c
but c
an c
unknown c
and c
not c
very c
good c
actor c
. c

Secondly c
the c
show c
started c
45 c
minutes c
late c
. c

Then c
at c
the c
tickets i
- c
office c
I c
was c
said i
that c
no c
discounts c
were c
available c
so c
I c
had c
to c
pay c
the c
full c
prize i
despite c
I i
am c
a c
student c
. c

Finally c
I c
would c
have c
had c
dinner c
at c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
if c
it c
had c
not c
been i
already c
closed c
because c
the c
show c
finished c
, c
obviously c
, c
late c
. c

I c
am c
really c
not c
satisfied c
with c
the c
show i
- c
organization c
particularly c
because c
in c
the c
advertisement c
you c
wrote c
something c
different i
. c

For c
this c
reason c
I c
expect c
to c
receive c
my c
money c
back c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
good c
at c
keeping c
secret i
. c

Last c
week c
we c
had c
another c
demostration i
of c
this c
. c

On c
Monday c
we c
decided c
to c
organize c
a c
surprise c
- i
party c
for c
Ted c
's c
birthday c
on c
Tuesday c
evening c
. c

Each c
of c
us c
had c
a c
different c
task c
. c

Anna c
prepared i
the c
cake c
, c
Peter c
organized c
the c
music c
, c
Heather c
and c
I c
went c
to c
buy c
the c
present c
; c
Pat c
said c
: c
" c
OK c
I i
'll c
phone c
to i
some c
of c
Ted c
's c
friends c
to c
invite c
them c
" c
. c

Obviously c
Ted c
should c
have i
known c
nothing i
about c
it c
and c
we c
remembered i
it c
to c
Pat c
twice c
: c
" c
the i
party c
is c
a c
secret c
! c
! c
" c
and c
she c
said c
: c
" c
Yes c
, c
it c
must c
be c
a c
surprise c
! c
" c

On c
Tuesday c
afternoon c
we c
met c
to c
prepare i
the c
last c
details c
; c
Pat c
said c
: c
" c
I c
've c
just c
phoned c
to i
Tommy c
, c
Billy c
and c
Alison c
and c
I c
met c
Ted c
yesterday c
evening c
: c
they c
all c
have c
said c
ok i
for c
the c
party c
.. c
" c

In i
that c
moment c
she c
understood c
that c
something c
was c
wrong c
! c

Dear c
Mr c
Robertson c
, c

Thank c
you c
for c
organising c
good i
programme c
, c
especially i
like c
sightseeing i
from c
River c
trip c
to c
Greenwich c
in c
London c
for c
three c
days c
. c

I c
am c
writing c
on c
behalf c
of c
my c
classmates c
to c
give c
the i
information c
of i
' c
The c
London c
Fashion c
And c
Leisure c
Show c
' c
which c
we c
would c
like c
to c
go c
and i
to c
huggest i
our c
opinion c
. c

We c
have c
seen c
an c
advertisement c
of i
last c
Saturday c
' i
The c
Times c
' c
edition c
of c
the c
show c
. c

It c
will c
be c
held c
in c
Central c
Exhibition c
Hall c
, c
London c
or i
Tuesday c
March c
14 c
from c
10.00 c
to c
19.00 c
. c

Firstly c
, c
it c
will c
introduce c
latest i
fashions c
connecting i
Millenium i
. c

Secondly c
, c
we c
will c
be c
able c
to c
see c
leisure c
and c
sports i
wear c
about c
fashion c
trend c
of c
next c
year c
. c

It c
would c
be c
fantastic i
opportunity c
to i
the c
students c
who c
study c
a i
fashion c
. c

Finally c
, c
we c
can c
see c
how c
to c
make i
up i
and c
make i
better c
hairstyle i
in c
the c
show c
. c

Most c
of c
all c
, c
It i
is c
free c
for c
students c
to c
enter c
. c

We c
would c
like c
to c
know c
if c
it c
is c
possible c
to c
change c
your c
programme c
. c

We c
would c
be c
grateful c
if c
we c
could c
go c
there c
in c
the c
afternoon c
on c
14 c
March c
because c
we c
are c
able c
to c
go c
shopping c
. c

We c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
Sincerely c
, c

It c
was c
dangerous c
, c
but c
I c
knew c
I c
had c
to c
do c
it c
. c

Whenever c
I c
recollet i
it c
, c
I c
feel c
self c
- c
confident c
. c

When c
I c
was c
twenty c
years c
old c
, c
I c
had c
to c
go c
to i
Army i
. c

As c
you c
know c
, c
my c
country c
has c
been c
separated c
into c
two c
countries c
( c
South c
and c
North c
Korea c
) c
. c

However c
, c
instead c
of c
going c
to i
Army i
, c
I c
was c
able c
to c
apply c
to c
Korea i
Auxiliary c
Police c
. c

One c
year c
later c
, c
I c
was c
working c
in c
Kang c
- c
nam c
police c
station c
in c
Seoul c
. c

Suddenly c
, c
the c
theft i
signal c
came c
into i
. c

So c
, c
another c
policeman c
and c
I c
had c
to c
arrive c
at c
the c
accident c
place c
quickly c
. c

When c
we c
arrived c
at c
the c
place c
which i
it c
happened c
, c
one c
man c
started c
running c
away c
. c

Without c
any c
thought c
, c
I c
ran c
quickly c
like c
a c
swallow c
. c

Then c
, c
he c
tried c
to c
go c
over c
the c
wall c
, c
I c
held c
his c
leg c
. c

He c
fell c
down c
and c
we c
had c
to c
stare c
at c
each c
other c
. c

After c
we c
fought c
for c
a c
minute c
, c
I c
was c
able c
to c
arrest c
him c
. c

As c
a c
result c
, c
I c
could c
go c
on c
vacation c
. c

When c
I c
said i
to c
my c
mother c
, c
she c
asked c
me c
not c
to c
do c
it c
again c
. c

But c
, c
I c
was c
a c
police i
- c
man c
. c

Therefore c
, c
I c
had c
to c
do c
it c
in c
spite c
of c
it c
being c
dangerous c
. c

Dear c
Competition c
Organiser c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
replay i
your i
letter c
and c
to c
ask c
more i
details c
about c
the c
competition c
. c

Firstly c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
say c
that c
I c
'm c
very c
glad c
to c
have c
been c
choosen i
and c
I c
will c
do c
my c
best c
for c
this c
competition c
. c

As c
you c
asked c
in c
the c
letter c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
travel c
only c
on i
july i
because c
I c
work c
at c
the c
central c
library c
and c
I c
'm c
also c
having c
English c
classes c
, c
so c
I c
will c
just c
have c
holidays c
on i
July c
. c

Is c
it i
suitable c
for c
you c
? c

As c
you c
mentioned c
about c
the c
accomodation i
, c
I c
would c
prefer c
stay i
in c
the i
tents i
, c
because c
it c
's c
more c
exciting c
and c
I c
really c
love c
camping c
. c

I c
examined c
all c
the c
activities c
that c
you c
listed c
and c
I c
was c
disappointed c
to c
have c
to c
chose i
just c
two c
of c
them c
because c
in c
my c
opinion c
I c
'm c
good c
in i
almost c
of i
this i
activities c
. c

However c
, c
I c
would c
choose c
sailing c
because c
I c
am c
facinating i
with c
the c
sea c
and c
it i
's c
misteries i
and c
I c
also c
like c
the c
watter i
, c
the c
wind c
in c
my c
face c
... c

The c
other c
one c
I c
would c
choose c
is c
basketball c
becouse i
I c
'm c
tall c
and c
very c
fast c
with c
the c
ball c
. c

Finally c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
what c
kind c
of c
clothes c
are i
we c
supposed c
to c
wear c
there c
, c
and c
about c
the c
money c
we c
are c
supposed c
to i
pay c
for c
food c
and c
things c
like c
that c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
receiving c
your c
prompt c
replay i
. c

sincerely c

I c

Last c

, c
I c

four c
bands c
. i

It c
was c
unbelivebly i
! c
! c
! c

Although c
it i
was i
5.000 i
thousand c
people c
there c
, c
people c
could c
walk c
and c
dance c
without c
any c
problem c
. c

It c
was c
very c
well c
organised c
, i
the c
shows i
started c
in i
the c
exactly c
time i
and c
the c
group c
were i
well i
performed c
too c
. c

I c
have i
contributed c
to c
the c
concert c
selling i
some c
tickets c
to c

However c
the i
success c
of c
the c
concert c
, c
at c
the c
end c
of c
show i
some c

a c
big c
confusion i
and c
some c
people c
get i
hurt c
. c

It c
was c
depressing c
... c

Finally c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
know c
some c
news c
about c
you c
, i
What c
have c

done c
? c

Be i

lot c
? c

from i
my c
childhood c
and c
it c
was c
not c
very i
good c
experience c
therefore i
I c
would c
like c

stay c
in c
cabin i
. c

You c
saying i
in c
your c
letter c
I c
could i
do c
two c
activities c
from c
the c
list c
which c
is i
show i
many c
exciting c
activities c
. c

I c
will i
definitly i
chose i
Basketball i
and c
Swimming i
wich i
are c
the i
my c
dream c
sport i
. c

I c
used c
to c
be i
play c
in c
school i
team c
when c
I c
was c
in c
high c
school c
and c
our c
team c
was c
the i
one c
of c
the c
best c
Basketball i
team i
in c
all i
county c
and c
I c
also i
very c
good c
at c
swim i
. c

I c
would c
like c
to c
ask c
a c
few c
things c
, c
specialy i
wheather i
: c
how i
is c
the c
weather c
in i
July c
in c
the c
U.S.A. i
What c
kind c
of c
clothes c
I i
will c
need c
and c
how c
much c
money c
I i
should c
take c
with c
me c
, i
Because c
I c
have c
never c
been c
U.S.A. i
before c
and i
I c
do c
n't c
know c
anything c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
your c
reply i
letter c
. c

Your i
sincerely c

I c
have c
never c
enjoyed c
doing c
shopping c
, c
but c
nowday i
some i
people c
are i
calling i
shopcholic i
. c

They c
are c
just c
like c
alcholics i
and c
this i
people c
are i
every c
day c
doing c
shopping c
because c
they c
can c
not c
stop c
themself i
unless c
they c
have c
not c
got c
money c
for i
spend i
. c

I c
can c
not c
believe c
how c
they c
doing i
this c
things i
every c
day c
, c
even c
when c
I c
need c
something c
at c
home c
I c
alway i
try c
to c
find c
out i
something c
to c
use c
instead c
of i
that c
things c
. c

Because c
nowdays i
whereever i
you c
go c
there c
is c
big i
queue c
and c
I c
hate c
being i
waited c
. c

The c
queue i
is i
not c
only i
the c
problem c
if i
you c
go c
by c
car c
there c
is c
parking i
problem c
, c
if c
you c
go c
by c
bus c
there c
is i
again i
queue i
and c
you c
have c
to c
carry c
many i
carry i
bag c
carrier c
bags c
during c
the i
your c
journey c
and c
you c
wo c
n't c
be i
alway c
luky i
to i
find c
a c
seat c
to i
seat c
. c

If c
you c
go c
shopping c
for c
( i
buy c
) c
clothes c
that c
is c
the c
worse i
kind c
of c
shopping c
. c

Specialy i
if c
you c
want c
to c
buy c
with i
your c
girlfriend c
or c
if c
you c
are c
already i
girl i
you i
have c
to c
be c
read i
for i
hours i
to c
spend c
try i
on c
and i
off c
. c

I c
realy i
hate c
go i
shopping c
with c
girls c
to c
buy c
clothes c
because c
when c
they c
went i
into c
a c
shop c
they c
want c
try i
on c
every c
single c
cloth i
and c
they c
do c
not c
realise c
to i
time c
. c

Some c
people c
says i
" c
shopping c
is c
not c
alway i
enjoyable c
" c
but c
for c
me c
definity i
unenjoyable c
and c
I c
think c
it c
will c
be c
same i
rest i
of c
my c
life c
. c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
with c
reference c
to c
the c
musical c
show c
I c
saw c
last c
week c
in c
your c
theatre c
. c

I c
hoped c
that c
it c
would c
be c
the c
most c
excited i
evening c
during c
my c
week c
's c
holiday c
in c
London c
. c

Unfortunately c
it c
was c
n't c
. c

I c
would c
n't c
like c
to c
be c
unkind c
but c
I c
must c
say c
that c
the c
advertisement c
for c
the c
show c
included c
a c
lot c
of c
false c
information c
. c

First c
of c
all c
, c
when c
I c
had i
bought c
the c
ticets i
it c
appeared c
that c
there c
is i
no c
discount c
available c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
must c
complain c
that c
the c
musical c
show c
started c
almost c
an c
hour c
later i
and c
in c
addition c
to c
this c
anyone i
did c
n't c
excuse c
. c

Moreover c
I i
would c
like c
to c
ask c
why c
Danny c
Brook c
, c
which i
is c
my c
favourite c
actor c
, c
did c
n't c
play i
in c
the c
show c
. c

Furthermore c
I i
would c
like c
to c
enquire c
why c
the c
theatre c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
. c

Finally c
, c
I c
must c
say c
that c
I c
had c
a c
very c
disappointing c
evening c
and c
I c
would c
like c
to c
get c
my c
money c
back c
. c

I c
look c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Your i
faithfully c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

I c
wish c
I c
had c
know i
it c
two c
days c
ago c
... c
Exacly i
on c
15th c
June c
we c
were c
at c
the c
birthday c
party c
. c

Dora c
wanted c
me c
to c
come c
with c
Pat c
because c
she c
was c
in c
love c
with c
him c
. c

I c
really c
like c
Dora c
and c
Pat c
and c
I c
just c
wanted c
to c
help c
them c
to c
be c
together c
, c
but c
it c
was c
n't c
such c
a c
good c
idea c
. c

I c
thought c
that c
if c
I c
said c
something c
specific c
about c
her c
he c
would c
look c
at c
her c
in c
a c
different c
way c
. c

Well c
, c
I c
forgot c
that c
it c
's c
just c
a c
boy c
! c

I c
should c
n't c
have c
told c
him c
that c
she c
was c
a c
virgin c
. c

It c
was c
awful c
when c
he c
started c
to c
laugh c
and c
everybody c
was c
stearing i
at c
us c
. c

Yesterday c
I i
discovered c
that c
he c
told c
everything c
to c
Marl c
and c
Tony c
. c

I c
really c
regret c
that c
I c
was c
so c
foolish c
. c

The c
most c
horrible c
is i
the c
fact c
that c
my c
friendship c
with c
Dora c
seems c
to c
be c
on c
the c
rocks c
and c
I c
do c
n't c
know c
what c
I c
have c
to c
do c
to c
overcome c
the c
difficulties c
. c

Mr. i
Manager c
: i

I c
am c
writing c
this c
letter c
to c
you c
because c
when c
I c
went c
to c
your c
Musical i
show c
I c
had c
a c
very c
bad c
time c
. c

Firstly c
when c
I c
went c
to c
the c
show c
it c
was c
writing i
that c
the c
starting i
time c
was c
19.30 c
but c
it c
started c
at c
quarter c
past c
eight c
I i
had c
waitted i
for c
fourthey i
five c
minutes c
. c

Secondly c
the c
stars c
were c
going c
to c
be c
DANNY c
BROOK c
and c
TINA c
TRUELOVE c
but c
different c
people c
came c
to c
the c
show c
. c

It c
was c
the c
first c
time c
I c
was i
going c
to i
go c
to c
a c
musical c
show c
but c
I c
guess c
it c
will c
be c
the c
last c
one c
too c
. c

Anyway c
after c
the c
show c
I c
felt c
hungry c
so c
I c
went c
to c
the c
restaurant c
but c
it c
was c
closed c
because c
they c
were c
having c
the c
inside c
altered c
. c

And c
as i
last i
that c
was c
the c
worse i
night c
I c
had c
ever c
had c
so c
I c
asked c
for c
my c
money c
back c
but c
they c
would c
n't c
give c
it i
so c
I c
had c
an c
argument c
with c
the c
people c
Who i
worked c
their i
but c
I c
could c
n't c
get c
my c
money c
back c
. c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

Because c
last c
year c
I c
started c
smoking c
and c
nobody c
knew c
that c
I c
was c
smoking c
but c
one c
day c
as c
I c
was c
smoking c
at c
the c
back c
of c
the c
school c
some i
one c
came c
next i
to c
me c
and c
I c
noticed c
that c
it c
was c
Pat c
. c

She c
saw c
me c
as c
I c
was c
smoking c
so c
that c
was c
n't c
going c
to c
be c
very c
good c
. c

She c
said c
that c
she c
would c
n't c
tell c
it i
to c
anyone c
but c
I c
knew c
she c
might c
say c
it c
to c
someone c
so c
I c
always i
was c
with c
her c
very i
minute c
ever i
second c
. c

But c
one c
day c
as c
I c
was c
walking c
home c
like c
every c
night c
I c
saw c
Pat c
at i
the c
front c
of c
our c
house c
door c
talking c
to c
my c
dad c
. c

I c
just c
knew c
I c
could i
n't c
have c
trusted c
to i
her c
but c
as c
I c
went c
in c
the c
house c
my c
dad c
offered i
pot i
to c
stay c
for c
meal i
I i
was c
in c
a i
schock i
thinking i
why c
is c
n't c
anyone c
getting c
angry c
to i
me c
after i
a c
while c
we c
sat c
for i
dinner c
and c
Pat c
just c
talk i
my c
parents c
that c
I c
was c
smoking c
and c
when c
my c
family c
heard c
they c
got c
ever c
so c
angry c
. c

I c
could c
n't c
go c
out c
of c
the c
house c
for c
a c
month c
so c
now c
I c
know c
how c
Pat c
is c
and c
ca i
n't c
keep c
any c
secrets c
. c

Dear c
Mister c

I c
'm c
writing c
to c
you c
to c
complain c
about c
the c
musical c
show c
you c
present i
at c
the c
moment c
: c
" c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
" c
. c

As c
my c
husband c
is c
a c
native c
and c
we c
live c
in c
Switzerland c
, c
we c
apreciate i
to i
pass c
a c
week c
in c
London c
every c
year c
. c

We c
are c
keen c
on c
theatre c
and c
musical c
show i
. c

Your c
theatre c
is c
known c
to c
present i
excellent c
spectacles i
. c

We c
were c
never c
disappointed c
so i
far c
and c
especially c
enjoyed c
" c
The c
Drama c
" c
you c
presented c
last c
year c
. c

Anyway c
we c
had c
a c
very c
disappointing c
evening c
. c

At i
first c
, c
we c
could c
n't c
get c
any i
discount c
, c
although c
you c
mention c
it c
on i
your c
advertisment i
. c

And c
the c
only c
tickets c
left c
were c
at i
£ c
20 c
. c

Then c
the c
spectacle i
began c
45 c
minutes c
later c
than c
mentioned i
. c

Last c
but c
not c
least c
, c
Danny c
Brook c
was c
replaced c
by c
a c
different c
actor c
, c
whose c
name c
I c
probably c
forgot c
because c
of c
his c
poor c
performance c
. c

Afterwards i
we c
are c
used c
to c
eat i
at c
your c
restaurant c
which c
is c
not c
only c
well c
known c
for c
it c
's c
good c
price i
value c
but c
also c
for c
it c
's c
original c
decoration i
. c

Therefore c
I c
ask c
you c
to c
give c
use i
£ c
20 c
back c
, c
because c
the c
two c
tickets c
were c
not c
more i
worth c
. c

I c
'm c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
soon i
from c
you c
. c

yours c
faithfully c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
n't c
really c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

The c
following c
story c
will c
prove c
it c
. c

I c
left c
the c
office c
at c
six c
o'clock c
. c

I c
was c
free c
as c
the c
air c
. c

My c
husband c
was c
following i
a c
course c
all c
the i
week c
in c
Berne c
. c

The c
kids c
were c
by i
their c
grandmother c
, c
who c
take i
care c
of c
them c
. c

I c
drove c
to c
Ouchy c
where c
I c
took i
a c
drink c
. c

It c
was c
so c
hot c
, c
I c
decided c
to c
go c
for c
a c
swim c
in c
tutry c
, c
although c
I c
had c
n't c
any i
swimming c
- i
clothes c
. c

I c
knew c
a c
good c
place c
. c

I c
parked c
the c
car c
and c
went i
ten c
minuts i
. c

As c
I c
had c
planed i
, c
the c
place c
was c
deserted c
. c

I c
took c
my c
clothes c
of i
and c
swam c
twenty i
minutes c
in c
the c
lake c
. c

Coming c
back c
, c
I c
noticed c
that c
my c
clothes c
were c
missing c
. c

I c
walked c
back c
, c
hoping c
I c
would c
n't c
come c
accross i
anyone c
and c
be c
able c
to c
drive c
back c
home c
. c

The c
car c
was c
missing c
too c
. c

Unfortunately c
a c
police c
car c
drove c
by c
and c
the c
policeman c
saw c
me c
standing c
there c
nude c
. c

They c
drove c
me c
to c
their c
office c
after c
having c
given c
me c
use i
of c
their c
shirt c
. c

There c
I c
called c
Pat c
who c
picked c
me c
up c
. c

I c
felt c
so c
miserable c
that c
Pat c
laughed c
seeing i
me c
. c

Of c
course c
she c
told c
everything c
to c
my c
husband c
. c

If c
only c
Pat c
could c
keep c
secrets c
! c

Dear c
Jane c
Clark c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
thank c
you c
for c
providing i
International i
Arts c
Festival c
. c

It c
was c
absolutely i
great c
idea c
. c

However c
, c
I c
would c
like c
to c
give c
some c
suggestions c
for c
next c
year c
as c
I c
have c
read c
the c
advertisement c
. c

Firstly c
, c
could c
you c
invite c
stars c
and c
artists c
from c
more c
than c
only c
six c
contries i
? c

In c
my c
opinion c
, c
it c
might c
be c
better c
to c
have c
time c
with c
variety i
nationallites i
. c

Secondly c
, c
the c
music c
concerts c
were c
very c
exciting c
and c
had i
a c
lot c
of c
fun c
, c
but c
some c
concert c
halls c
were c
too c
small c
to c
enjoy c
them c
comfortably c
. c

Thirdly c
, c
I c
am c
expecting c
to c
watch c
more c
films c
and c
plays c
which i
were c
impressive c
. c

Lastly c
, c
it c
could c
be c
nice c
to i
students c
who c
are c
interested c
in c
arts i
, c
if c
you c
help i
special c
events c
, c
for c
instance c
, c
song i
contest c
, c
writing c
competition c
or c
dance c
lessons c
. c

To c
sum c
up c
, c
I c
hope c
the c
festival c
is c
developed i
next c
year c
with c
excellent c
reasonably c
- c
priced c
ticket i
like c
this c
year c
's c
. c

Yours c
sincerely c
, c

PART c
TIME c
JOBS c
: c
Find c
in i
your c
place c

Do c
you c
need c
money c
? c

If c
you c
do c
, c
make i
sure c
why c
you c
want c
to c
earn c
money c
. c

That c
is c
very c
important c
to c
find c
a c
way c
for i
earning c
and c
saving c
money c
. c

Probably c
the c
best c
way c
you c
can c
get c
money c
is c
to c
have c
a c
part c
time i
job c
in c
your c
spare c
time c
. c

I c
am c
recommending c
you c
to i
check c
your c
possible c
time c
to c
work c
- c
weekdays c
or c
weekend c
? c
- c
before c
you c
request i
a c
job c
. c

If c
you c
just c
decide c
to c
work c
, c
you c
'd c
better c
to i
find c
a c
job c
in i
your c
place c
. c

Firstly c
, c
go c
to c
your c
school c
or c
local c
council c
. c

They c
will c
be c
able c
to c
help c
to c
find c
safe c
and c
suitable c
jobs c
for c
students c
like c
you c
. c

Secondly c
, c
as i
your c
family c
or c
friends c
. c

As c
they c
know c
about c
your c
interestings i
and c
personality c
, c
it c
is c
easy c
to c
help c
you c
. c

In c
my c
case c
, c
I i
could c
get c
a c
telephone c
researcher c
part c
by c
my c
friend c
's c
reference c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
do c
n't c
forget c
that c
a c
job c
is c
just c
spent i
in c
your c
" c
spare c
" c
time c
. c

That c
's c
it c
! c

Dear c
Sir c
/ c
Madam c
, c

I c
am c
writing c
to c
make c
a c
complaint c
about c
the c
show c
' c
Over c
the c
Rainbow c
' c
. c

During c
my c
stay c
in c
London c
I c
went c
to c
your c
theatre c
to c
see c
this c
show c
. c

As i
it c
is i
said c
in c
your c
advertisement c
, i
the c
show c
is i
starring c
Danny c
Brook c
but i
there c
was c
different i
actor c
. i

It i
is c
not c
the c
only c
problem c
. c

The c
show c
had i
to c
start c
at c
19:30 c
, c
but c
it c
started c
at c
20:15 c
. c

You c
promised c
that c
there c
will i
be c
discounts c
, c
but c
when c
I c
came i
, c
I c
found c
out c
, i
that c
they c
were c
not c
available c
. c

I c
wanted c
to c
go c
to c
your c
restaurant c
. c

I c
invited c
a c
friend c
of c
mine c
and c
promised c
her c
that c
we c
will i
go c
there c
. c

And c
what c
I c
found c
out c
. c

Your c
restaurant c
was c
closed c
. c

You c
promised c
that c
if c
we c
go i
to c
your c
show c
we c
will i
have c
a c
perfect c
evening c
. c

Everything c
was c
just c
vice i
versa c
. c

I c
am c
very c
disappointed c
, i
that c
is c
why c
I c
am c
asking c
you c
for c
compensation c
. c

I c
am c
looking c
forward c
to c
hearing c
from c
you c
. c

Yours c
faithfully c
, c

Unfortunately c
, c
Pat c
was c
not c
very c
good c
at c
keeping c
secrets c
. c

It c
happened c
at c
the c
end c
of c
school i
year c
. c

My c
class c
was c
going c
to c
a c
night i
disco c
and c
I c
wanted c
to c
go c
there c
too c
. c

I c
asked c
my c
parents c
if c
I c
could c
go c
, c
but c
they c
did c
not c
let c
me c
do c
that c
. c

I c
tried c
to c
persuade c
them c
, c
told i
that c
nothing c
will i
happen c
to c
me c
, c
promised c
to c
do c
all c
housework i
. c

But c
all c
they c
have i
done c
is i
told i
me c
that c
I c
am c
to c
young c
for c
it i
and c
I c
can c
go c
there c
only c
when c
I c
am c
20 c
years c
old c
. c

I c
had c
such c
a c
desire c
to c
go c
to c
the c
disco c
, i
that c
I c
decided c
to c
go c
even c
without c
parent i
's c
permission c
. c

I c
told c
my c
secret c
to c
my c
best c
friend c
Pat i
. c

But c
she c
told c
it c
to c
very i
kid c
in c
school c
, c
even c
the c
teachers c
heard c
it c
. c

It c
occured i
that c
one c
of c
the c
teachers c
told c
my c
parents c
about c
it c
. c

At i
the c
end c
I c
was c
punished c
and c
stayed c
at c
home c
for c
two c
weeks c
. c

I c
understood c
that c
I c
must c
keep c
my c
secrets c
and c
do i
not c
tell c
anybody c
, c
even c
the i
best c
friend c
. c

Dear c
Mrs. c
Jane c
X c
, c

I c
would c
like c
to c
make c
some c
appoitments i
about c
the c
event c
that c
I c
had i
been c
. i

First c
of c
all c
, c
the c
concert c
hall c
is c
too c
small c
to c
have c
a c
great c
concert c
. c

I c
think c
should i
be c
bigger c
for c
jazz c
, c
rock c
or c
still i
classical c
concerts c
. c

Secondly c
, c
I c
had c
some c
ideas c
for c
the c
next c
year c
events i
, c
such c
as c
: i

- c
Funny c
plays c
and c
films c
to c
spend i
the c
break c
time i
; c

- c
Dance c
shows c
after c
dinner c
to c
have i
something c
interesting c
to c
do c
in c
the c
night c
, i

- c
Art c
exbitions i
to c
know i
more i
things c
about c
artist i
's c
lifestyle c
; c
and c

- c
talks c
by c
writers c
to c
say c
how c
good c
is i
his c
latest c
book c
. c

In c
addictions i
, c
the c
ticket i
's c
price c
is i
too c
expensive c
and c
difficult i
to c
buy c
another i
one c
every c
day c
, i
so c
, c
I c
think c
is i
more c
effective c
if c
was i
one c
reasonably c
- c
priced c
weekend c
ticket c
for c
all c
events c
. c

In c
conclusion c
, c
I c
hope i
will i
be c
better c
next c
year c
if c
these c
points c
was i
observed c
for i
the c
each c
year c
the c
event c
to c
be c
better c
than c
before c
. c

Sincerely c

How c
are c
you c
? c

It c
was c
nice c
to c
receive i
notices i
about c
you c
. c

I c
remember c
these i
time c
in c
our c
class c
when c
us i
talking i
many i
time c
about c
rules c
and c
I i
am c
missing c
that c
